--My name is Randy Bryant. 00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,200
我的名字是兰迪布莱恩特。
--I'm one of the instructors for the course, 15.418 or 6.18. 00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:08,640
我是 15.418 或 6.18 课程的讲师之一。
--And with me today are some other people. 00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:13,560
今天和我一起的还有其他一些人。
--So this is actually my third time through this course. 00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:19,920
所以这实际上是我第三次完成这门课程。
--I co-taught it before. 00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:21,680
我以前合作教过它。
--But the person I co-taught it with decided he wanted to be in a sunnier climate. 00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:26,520
但是和我一起教它的人决定他想要一个阳光明媚的气候。
--And so this time I've recruited Greg Kesden, who's in the back. 00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:32,120
所以这次我招募了坐在后面的 Greg Kesden。
--Hey, everybody. 00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:34,000
大家好
--Greg is actually at the Information Networking Institute, 00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,560
格雷格实际上在信息网络研究所，
--which is over on Craig Street, off of Craig Street. 00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:40,560
它在克雷格街附近的克雷格街上。
--That's where his office is. 00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:42,360
他的办公室就在那里。
--But he's been a part of, was here at NCS for quite a few years, too. 00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:48,000
但他一直是 NCS 的一员，也在 NCS 工作了好几年。
--And then decided he wanted to be in San Diego and didn't like the weather. 00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,640
然后决定他想去圣地亚哥并且不喜欢那里的天气。
--So he's back here. 00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:53,800
所以他回来了。
--And today, and for a good part of this month, 00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:56,760
今天，在这个月的大部分时间里，
--Todd Mowry, who's sitting down here, will be providing guest lectures. 00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:00,960
坐在这里的托德·莫瑞 (Todd Mowry) 将提供客座讲座。
--Todd's taught this, actually designed, created this course originally many years 00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:05,920
托德教这个，实际上设计，创造这门课程原来很多年
--ago, and has taught the course many times, and he's sort of helping out, 00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:10,880
以前，并多次教授这门课程，他有点帮忙，
--especially in the, the startup part, phase of this course. 00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:14,640
特别是在本课程的启动部分阶段。
--So this is a very exciting course. 00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,280
所以这是一个非常令人兴奋的课程。
--We really dig in and do a, a very hands-on experience in parallel computing. 00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:22,120
我们真正深入挖掘并做了一个非常亲身实践的并行计算体验。
--And I know, having done this myself, when I, 00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:26,160
我知道，我自己做了这件事，当我，
--when I officially was an instructor of the course two years ago, 00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:30,200
两年前我正式担任这门课程的讲师时，
--what I did was I did all the labs, and 00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:33,800
我所做的是我做了所有的实验室，并且
--I purposely didn't look at the solutions, even though I could. 00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:38,280
我故意不看解决方案，即使我可以。
--I forced myself to really do them, and I found it really hard, but 00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:42,920
我强迫自己真的去做了，我发现真的很难，但是
--also that I learned a whole lot from it, and 00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:45,640
我还从中学到了很多东西，并且
--it's been really useful to me in many other ways. 00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:47,920
它在许多其他方面对我真的很有用。
--So, I think that's the way you'll experience it, too. 00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:51,120
所以，我认为这也是你体验它的方式。
--So, as you see, there's a lot of people in this room, and 00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:56,200
所以，如你所见，这个房间里有很多人，而且
--we have a crazy wait list for this course. 00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:02,320
对于这门课程，我们有一个疯狂的候补名单。
--So, as of last night, we had 118 students enrolled, but 172 on the wait list. 00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:10,440
所以，截至昨晚，我们有 118 名学生注册，但有 172 名学生在候补名单上。
--So, more waiting than enrolled. 00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:13,120
所以，等待比注册更多。
--And this room, according to the fire marshal, can hold 144 people and no more. 00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:19,280
根据消防队长的说法，这个房间最多只能容纳 144 人。
--And so, we're not allowed to add any more students than that. 00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:22,840
因此，我们不允许添加更多的学生。
--So, you do the math, and you come up with 26, is how many spots. 00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:27,000
所以，你算一算，你得出 26，是多少个点。
--Now, the one, one thing I'll say is, those of you who are registered, 00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:33,560
现在，我要说的一件事是，你们中那些已注册的人，
--I hope you really want to take this course. 00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:36,360
我希望你真的想参加这门课程。
--And if you're sort of thinking, maybe I'm not sure if I've got time, or 00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:41,720
如果你在想，也许我不确定我是否有时间，或者
--might be overbooked a bit, a little bit, I'd really like to, 00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:47,320
可能会被超额预订一点，一点点，我真的很想，
--you to make that commitment by the, 00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:51,600
你做出这样的承诺，
--even though it's not the drop date, is way into the future, if you would think of 00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:56,960
即使这不是投放日期，也是未来的方式，如果你会想到
--the end of this month as being when you should really duck out of the course if 00:02:56,960 --> 00:03:00,880
这个月底是你真的应该退出课程的时候，如果
--you're not committed to it, to try and open up some more slots for 00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:05,160
你不致力于它，尝试为它打开更多的插槽
--students who are waiting, just for the benefit of the class. 00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:10,680
等待的学生，只为班级的利益。
--And we can't force you to drop, though. 00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:15,160
不过，我们不能强迫您放弃。
--But if you're sort of on the fence, then this would be a good opportunity. 00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:19,560
但如果你有点犹豫，那么这将是一个很好的机会。
--And what we're going to do is use assignment one as our sort of gateway. 00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:26,600
我们要做的是使用作业一作为我们的网关。
--So for those of you enrolled in the class, 00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:29,240
所以对于那些报名参加课程的人来说，
--even though assignment one isn't due until 12 days from now, 00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:35,280
即使作业一要到 12 天后才到期，
--it's a pretty good gauge of what kind of expectations we have. 00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:38,320
这是衡量我们有什么样的期望的一个很好的衡量标准。
--Sort of how we expect you to make use of resources, 00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:41,680
我们希望您如何利用资源，
--how you, we, kind of work we expect you to be able to do. 00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:45,120
你，我们，我们希望你能做什么工作。
--And so, I'd encourage everyone to get started on that assignment. 00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:49,920
因此，我鼓励大家开始这项任务。
--And it'll be a pretty good calibration of, of what this course is going to be like, 00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:54,080
这将是对这门课程将会是什么样子的一个很好的校准，
--and what our expectations are. 00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:56,160
以及我们的期望是什么。
--Those of you on the wait list, here's your opportunity to shine. 00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:59,000
那些在等候名单上的人，这是你们大放异彩的机会。
--We're going, it's already out, and we're going to look at 00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:05,480
我们要去，它已经出来了，我们要看看
--completed assignments by a week from tonight, January 24th. 00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:13,840
从 1 月 24 日今晚开始的一周内完成作业。
--And we'll look at all the submitted assignments from that, and 00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:18,920
我们会查看所有提交的作业，然后
--have a pretty active session on grading. 00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:23,560
有一个非常活跃的评分会议。
--And we'll take the top student, top performers from that assignment, and 00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:27,080
我们会选出最优秀的学生，那些作业中表现最好的人，然后
--that will determine who gets off the wait list and 00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:29,960
这将决定谁从候补名单中脱颖而出
--is allowed to register for the course. 00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:32,400
被允许注册课程。
--And that's it. 00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,280
就是这样。
--There's no other rules about how we're going to do the wait list. 00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:36,200
关于我们如何处理等候名单，没有其他规则。
--So it's considered a, a very severe form of meritocracy. 00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:41,760
所以它被认为是一种非常严厉的精英管理形式。
--That we, we don't care what your position on the wait list is. 00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:45,760
我们，我们不关心你在等候名单上的位置。
--We don't care whether you're undergraduates or graduate students. 00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:48,560
我们不管你是本科生还是研究生。
--We don't under care if this is your last semester at CMU. 00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:52,600
如果这是您在 CMU 的最后一个学期，我们不在乎。
--None of those factors will be considered. 00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,360
这些因素都不会被考虑。
--It will be purely 100% based on the performance in this assignment. 00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:59,560
它将纯粹 100% 基于此任务中的表现。
--And so, that, you can do the math and figure out what the, the, 00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:06,400
所以，那个，你可以做数学并弄清楚什么，那个，
--the rate's going to be. 00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:09,280
利率将是。
--And hopefully, there'll be some more slots available. 00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:12,440
希望会有更多可用的插槽。
--But those of you who are I think, well, 00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:18,440
但我认为你们中的那些人，好吧，
--you've got a week to, to sort of really go crazy on this assignment and 00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:23,320
你有一个星期的时间，在这个任务上真的有点疯狂
--do the best you can, and we'll see what happens after that. 00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:26,440
尽你所能，我们会看看之后会发生什么。
--I can't make any promises to anyone about what standards they are, 00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:30,560
我不能向任何人承诺他们是什么标准，
--how good it has to be. 00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:31,640
它有多好。
--I don't actually know what it will take to get in, but that's the bar. 00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:37,640
我实际上不知道需要什么才能进入，但这就是酒吧。
--And so, the, the thing is, go for it. 00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:40,920
所以，事情是，去争取吧。
--And like I said, there's no hidden trick. 00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:45,240
就像我说的，没有隐藏的技巧。
--There's no special deal. 00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,920
没有特别优惠。
--There's no lobbying. 00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:49,360
没有游说。
--I'm immune to deliveries of, of chocolate at my door, or any of those things. 00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:55,560
我对送货上门的巧克力或任何这些东西免疫。
--It just won't work. 00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:56,240
它只是行不通。
--So, what is this course? 00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:01,720
那么，这个课程是什么？
--Well, as far as what you will be doing, you will be coming to lectures like this. 00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:07,280
嗯，至于你要做什么，你会像这样来听课。
--But really, most of your time is going to be spent working on assignments and projects. 00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:14,560
但实际上，您的大部分时间都将花在作业和项目上。
--It's a very heavily work activity oriented type of course. 00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:20,440
当然，这是一种非常注重工作活动的类型。
--It's learning by doing in a fairly extreme form. 00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:24,280
它是以一种相当极端的形式边做边学。
--So in particular, the, the, there'll be four of these assignments, 00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:29,720
所以特别是，将有四个这样的作业，
--each taking roughly two weeks or so, including the first one that's out. 00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:36,360
每个大约需要两周左右，包括第一个出来的。
--And the interesting thing is, each of these four sort of covers some different 00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:41,440
有趣的是，这四种类型中的每一种都涵盖了一些不同的
--way in which computers achieve speed up via parallelism. 00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:47,200
计算机通过并行性实现加速的方式。
--And, and that's one of the interesting aspects of this course, 00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:50,880
而且，这是本课程有趣的方面之一，
--is hardware manufacturers have tried to figure out many different ways of 00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:56,160
是硬件制造商试图找出许多不同的方法
--sort of squeezing more performance out of the hardware they can build. 00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:00,160
从他们可以构建的硬件中挤出更多的性能。
--And they've done it by coming up with very different types of parallelism. 00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:06,160
他们通过提出非常不同类型的并行性来做到这一点。
--And the course as a result is, you're really doing software. 00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:11,200
结果就是，你真的在做软件。
--All the courses involves writing code. 00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:14,400
所有课程都涉及编写代码。
--But you have to understand and 00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,600
但你必须了解并
--appreciate the hardware in order to be effective at it. 00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:19,520
欣赏硬件以使其有效。
--So in particular, the first one will make use of the type of parallelism that is 00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:25,440
所以特别是，第一个将利用并行性的类型
--involved in, in essentially all processor chips today. 00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:30,320
涉及，基本上涉及当今所有的处理器芯片。
--That includes the, these multiple cores. 00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:33,200
这包括这些多核。
--But also, the arithmetic units within the cores can do multiple instructions in 00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:38,360
而且，内核中的算术单元可以执行多条指令
--parallel, what's called SIMD, Single Instruction Multiple Data Instructions. 00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:43,200
并行，所谓的 SIMD，单指令多数据指令。
--And so you'll be exploring how both of those can be exploited using a language 00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:48,960
因此，您将探索如何使用一种语言来利用这两者
--called ISPC that was developed by some researchers at Intel. 00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:53,480
称为 ISPC，由英特尔的一些研究人员开发。
--And is a, a fairly interesting language. 00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:55,960
并且是一种相当有趣的语言。
--The second one involves what are called GPUs, or Graphic Processing Units. 00:07:55,960 --> 00:08:00,080
第二个涉及所谓的 GPU 或图形处理单元。
--So GPUs were, as the name suggests, a term, 00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:03,480
顾名思义，GPU 是一个术语，
--a technology developed originally to help make graphics faster. 00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:07,200
一项最初开发的技术，旨在帮助加快图形处理速度。
--And in fact, the main market for it was game boxes. 00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:10,800
事实上，它的主要市场是游戏盒。
--And some clever people figured out that you could sort of create 00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:16,440
一些聪明的人发现你可以创造
--specialized processors that would make graphics run way faster. 00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:20,720
可以使图形运行速度更快的专用处理器。
--And then some other smart people realized, hey, 00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,800
然后其他一些聪明人意识到，嘿，
--this technique is more generally applicable than just graphics. 00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:26,600
这种技术比图形更普遍。
--And they started to make them a little bit more general purpose. 00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:31,840
他们开始使它们更具通用性。
--And make them more programmable using different programming notations. 00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:38,320
并使用不同的编程符号使它们更具可编程性。
--And they've become now the way that you can get some really remarkable performance 00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:42,880
现在它们已经成为你获得非凡表现的方式
--out of a basically a single chip is what they're implemented on. 00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:47,840
它们基本上是在一个芯片上实现的。
--And then assignment three will look at the what's known as shared memory 00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:55,920
然后作业三将查看所谓的共享内存
--parallelism, meaning that sort of if you take the idea of a multi-core and, and, 00:08:55,920 --> 00:09:00,400
并行性，这意味着如果你采用多核的想法，并且，
--and, and expand it up to say, imagine I have a bunch of processors. 00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:05,560
并且，扩展它说，想象我有一堆处理器。
--And they can all execute independent programs. 00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:10,320
而且他们都可以执行独立的程序。
--And, but they all have one common memory, 00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,480
而且，但他们都有一个共同的记忆，
--that if I do a write from one, it can be read by another. 00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:17,160
如果我写了一个，它可以被另一个读取。
--And then the final assignment will be to do the same type of problem, but 00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:20,960
然后最后的作业将是做同样类型的问题，但是
--to do it in what's called message passing. 00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:23,320
在所谓的消息传递中做到这一点。
--Where again, you have a box with a bunch of processors. 00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:26,280
再一次，你有一个装有一堆处理器的盒子。
--But they have independent, or you view them as having separate memories. 00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:30,880
但是他们有独立的，或者你认为他们有独立的记忆。
--And if they want to communicate with each other, 00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,560
如果他们想互相交流，
--they have to explicitly send a message from one to the other. 00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:35,920
他们必须明确地从一个人向另一个人发送消息。
--And so these two models are sort of well, all of these are sort of in, 00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:40,000
所以这两个模型都很好，所有这些都在，
--in various forms built into many of the computers that we encounter today. 00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,720
以各种形式内置于我们今天遇到的许多计算机中。
--So that's a really big part of the course though. 00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,480
所以这是课程的一个非常重要的部分。
--And I think you'll find that you're quite busy, but 00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:52,040
我想你会发现你很忙，但是
--also it, if you like to program, and 00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:56,640
还有它，如果你喜欢编程，和
--you like to make things run fast, it's also a lot of fun. 00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:59,680
你喜欢让事情跑得快，这也很有趣。
--The other part of the course is that a big component of the course is a final 00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:08,200
课程的另一部分是课程的很大一部分是期末考试
--project, and this is a case where you get to sort of set your own 00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:12,800
项目，在这种情况下，您可以自行设置
--ideas on what you want to do and take away with it. 00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:16,560
关于您想做什么的想法并带走它。
--And it counts a, a quarter of your grade, so it's a big part. 00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:20,120
它占你成绩的四分之一，所以它很重要。
--And roughly speaking, you should think of a project as being about twice 00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:24,240
粗略地说，您应该将一个项目视为大约两倍
--the equivalent of two of the homework assignments. 00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:26,400
相当于两个家庭作业。
--And the these range and, and there's some links in these slides for 00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:36,480
这些范围和这些幻灯片中有一些链接
--what were done in the previous two terms, just to give you an idea. 00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:39,640
前两个学期做了什么，只是为了给你一个想法。
--But they range from something like, I have an application domain that I think 00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:43,800
但它们的范围包括，我有一个我认为的应用程序域
--would benefit from running faster, say computer vision or graphics. 00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:47,960
会受益于运行得更快，比如计算机视觉或图形。
--Or a molecular simulation or, or any of these many range of computational problems. 00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:54,960
或分子模拟，或这些许多范围内的计算问题中的任何一个。
--And I'd just like to map them onto one of those types of machines that we've 00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:59,840
我只想将它们映射到我们已经拥有的那些类型的机器之一
--looked at already and make it run faster. 00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:02,840
已经看过并使其运行得更快。
--And so that's a, a good type of project. 00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:05,400
所以这是一个很好的项目。
--Another is, well, I got really interested in these locking mechanisms that were 00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:09,760
另一个是，好吧，我对这些锁定机制非常感兴趣
--discussed in class, and I want to do some very careful experiments to compare how 00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:14,640
在课堂上讨论过，我想做一些非常仔细的实验来比较
--they do depending on the characteristics of the, the system and 00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:19,640
他们根据系统的特性和
--the data that you're running, so those are, are two styles of it. 00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:23,640
您正在运行的数据是两种类型。
--And then some one of the interesting things about this world is that the, 00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:28,720
然后关于这个世界的一些有趣的事情是，
--these things that we all carry in our pockets nowadays have 00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:32,760
现在我们都放在口袋里的这些东西有
--a lot of parallel computing capability built in. 00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:35,120
内置大量并行计算能力。
--They have multiple processors and they also have GPUs that are a little 00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:40,760
他们有多个处理器，他们也有一些 GPU
--harder to program than NVIDIA GPUs, but they can be done. 00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:45,120
比 NVIDIA GPU 更难编程，但它们可以完成。
--And so a lot of interesting projects have come of things that were running on 00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:49,160
因此，许多有趣的项目都来自正在运行的东西
--people's phones, or phone based, Android in particular based systems. 00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:54,480
人们的电话，或基于电话，尤其是基于 Android 的系统。
--So there's really a, a wide range of, of possibilities there. 00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:58,840
所以那里真的有很多可能性。
--But what I'd recommend is that you sort of keep your eyes out from now until 00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:07,480
但我建议你从现在开始直到
--you're supposed to come up with a project for various ideas. 00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:10,400
您应该针对各种想法提出一个项目。
--What is it that you get excited by? 00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:11,920
你对什么感到兴奋？
--Is there something you'd like to explore more that's been touched on in the class? 00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:15,920
在课堂上有没有你想探索更多的东西？
--Is there something from outside of this course that you'd like to bring in 00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:20,120
您想引入本课程之外的内容吗？
--as an application domain? 00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:21,400
作为一个应用领域？
--So those are all good things to be thinking about. 00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:24,160
所以这些都是值得考虑的好事情。
--There'll be a little bit of, of what I'm calling quizzes. 00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:34,960
会有一些我称之为测验的内容。
--But this will be actually a, a teeny tiny fraction of your grade. 00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:38,080
但这实际上只是你成绩的一小部分。
--In particular, we're going to give you some take home 00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:42,840
特别是，我们会给你一些带回家
--problems that you can work on before the exams. 00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:45,880
您可以在考试前解决的问题。
--And they're more like exam prep type of stuff 00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:48,960
而且它们更像是考试准备类型的东西
--than anything we actually care about your answers. 00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:52,000
我们真正关心的是您的答案。
--So our grading will be essentially pass, fail on these. 00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,960
所以我们的评分基本上是通过，不通过这些。
--But it's just a way to get you sort of ready and 00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:59,720
但这只是让你做好准备的一种方式
--thinking because as you've probably experienced in other courses, 00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:03,080
思考是因为正如你可能在其他课程中经历过的那样，
--if you do a lot of writing code for a course and then you step and 00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:06,960
如果你为一门课程写了很多代码然后你一步一步
--you take an exam, all of a sudden the exam problems seem way different 00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:11,760
你参加考试，突然间考试题看起来很不一样
--than what you've had in, in how you've experienced during the labs. 00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:16,800
比你在实验室中的经历更重要。
--And so this is partly a way to kind of get you thinking about what, 00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:21,160
所以这在某种程度上是一种让你思考什么的方法，
--how you need to be looking at problems and, and getting ready for an exam. 00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:26,560
您需要如何看待问题，并为考试做好准备。
--We'll also make a little bit of use of these online quizzes. 00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:31,480
我们还将稍微利用这些在线测验。
--I know for me, I did them in 213 for the first time last fall. 00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:37,160
我知道对我来说，去年秋天我第一次在 213 做了它们。
--And I think they're a, a useful way to kind of get people, and 00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:41,400
我认为它们是一种吸引人的有用方法，并且
--actually fairly useful feedback for the instructors for 00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:45,640
对教师来说实际上相当有用的反馈
--sort of tracking the, the lecture material as it goes on. 00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:49,160
有点像跟踪讲座材料的进行。
--And that will have a, again, a small factor in the grade. 00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:54,000
这再次对成绩产生了很小的影响。
--But neither, none of this, all of this, we'll talk about the point spread, but 00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,240
但是，都不是，都不是，所有这些，我们将讨论点传播，但是
--all of this everything described here counts a total of three out of 100 points 00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:03,640
所有这一切在这里描述的一切总计 100 分中的三分
--for this course, so this is not the biggest part of your grade. 00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:07,520
对于这门课程，所以这不是你成绩中最重要的部分。
--It's more ways to kind of keep you up and, and moving along with the material. 00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:12,240
它有更多的方法可以让你保持清醒，并与材料一起移动。
--So that's, here is the spread. 00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:17,400
这就是传播。
--So the assignments, and by the way, 00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:20,840
所以任务，顺便说一句，
--there, there's a syllabus on the class web page you can get to. 00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:24,600
在那里，您可以访问课程网页上的教学大纲。
--And it gives all the breakdown. 00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:27,240
它给出了所有的故障。
--So the four assignments count 40%. 00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:30,040
因此，四项作业占 40%。
--Yes? 00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:30,560
是的？
--So could you consider the quizzes like as practice exams? 00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:34,400
那么您可以将测验视为练习考试吗？
--Yeah. 00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:35,120
是的。
--The, the take home quizzes will look like practice exams. 00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:37,600
带回家的测验看起来像练习考试。
--The programming assignments count 40%. 00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:44,560
编程作业占 40%。
--The project counts 25. 00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:46,040
项目数25。
--So there, together, is two-thirds of the, the grade for the course will be based on. 00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:51,560
因此，总共有三分之二的课程成绩将基于。
--On, you know, doing stuff. 00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:58,800
继续，你知道，做事。
--That's really the main focus. 00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,720
这才是真正的重点。
--We'll also do two exams, and you can see on the class schedule when those will be. 00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:04,480
我们还将进行两次考试，您可以在课程表上看到这些考试的时间。
--They'll be held in class. 00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:06,080
他们将在课堂上举行。
--And again, they'll, they'll be more solving problems that sort of push the ideas and 00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:14,160
再一次，他们会，他们会更多地解决问题，推动想法和
--concepts of the course rather than your ability to get code working and, and 00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:19,400
课程的概念，而不是你让代码工作的能力，以及
--make it run fast. 00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:21,240
让它跑得快。
--And as I mentioned, these sort of quiz in class type of activities will count 3%. 00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:27,400
正如我提到的，这类课堂活动中的测验将占 3%。
--There's also a, a scheme for late days. 00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:30,800
还有一个，迟到的计划。
--In other words, grace days, if you've took, took 213, 513. 00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:36,440
换句话说，宽限日，如果你已经拿走了，拿了 213、513。
--That it's a little bit too complicated to explain here, but 00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:40,920
在这里解释起来有点太复杂了，但是
--it's fairly well described on the web page, so just look at that. 00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:44,640
网页上描述得相当好，所以看看那个。
--But in other words, there is a system to kind of give you a little bit more 00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:48,600
但换句话说，有一个系统可以给你多一点
--flexibility in your schedule as far as, as turning in assignments. 00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:52,840
灵活安排你的日程安排，就像上交作业一样。
--And so right now, as of yesterday and today, there's a class web page. 00:15:57,760 --> 00:16:05,280
所以现在，从昨天和今天开始，有一个班级网页。
--And there's a piazza. 00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:07,120
还有一个广场。
--You don't have to actually there's, anyone can sign up for an account. 00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:11,680
你不必真的有，任何人都可以注册一个帐户。
--There's no, you just basically follow that account. 00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:15,120
没有，你基本上就是关注那个账号。
--You don't need to do anything special to use our class's piazza. 00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:19,240
你不需要做任何特别的事情来使用我们班级的广场。
--There's no textbook from the, the course. 00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:22,920
该课程没有教科书。
--There's a few references given in the syllabus. 00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:26,960
教学大纲中提供了一些参考资料。
--But in fact one, one of the, 00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:31,720
但事实上，其中之一，
--the features of this subject is it keeps moving along so much that the textbooks. 00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:38,040
这门学科的特点是它一直在不断发展，以至于教科书。
--Really I don't know of anyone who's made a serious effort at writing a textbook on 00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:41,520
真的，我不知道有谁认真努力写过关于
--this in years, so the textbooks are already looking a bit dated. 00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:44,880
这几年，所以教科书看起来已经有点过时了。
--And so quite honestly, we'll use these slides in the presentation. 00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:52,320
老实说，我们将在演示文稿中使用这些幻灯片。
--Material you can find online will be your main references for the course. 00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:55,560
您可以在网上找到的资料将是您学习本课程的主要参考资料。
--Another thing is starting with assignment two and 00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:00,320
另一件事是从作业二开始
--ever after you can either work alone or you can work with one other person as 00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:05,600
从此以后，您既可以单独工作，也可以与其他人一起工作
--a partner, so again, you don't have to do this right away, but, and 00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:10,200
一个合作伙伴，所以再一次，你不必马上这样做，但是，和
--we don't do anything as far as matching up people or, or 00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:14,320
我们不做任何事情来匹配人或者，或者
--helping people get along with each other. 00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:17,440
帮助人们彼此相处。
--That's all up to you. 00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:18,400
这完全取决于你。
--So you might be sort of thinking about possible how you'd like to, 00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:25,040
所以你可能正在考虑可能的方式，
--who, whom you'd like to work with for the course. 00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:26,800
谁，你想和谁一起学习这门课程。
--The class, it meets on Monday, Wednesday, Friday. 00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:33,840
周一、周三、周五上课。
--And you'll see on the schedule though that some are designated, 00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:38,960
你会在时间表上看到有些是指定的，
--they're called recitations. 00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:41,440
他们被称为朗诵。
--And obviously a room this size doesn't have a recitation where 00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:47,000
很明显，这么大的房间没有朗诵会
--everybody's sort of interacting and things like that. 00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,040
每个人都在互动之类的。
--But the idea of these will be a few targeted and 00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:54,680
但是这些想法会有一些针对性和
--they're all sort of designated related to some of the assignments to help give you 00:17:54,680 --> 00:18:00,480
它们都是与某些作业相关的指定，以帮助您
--some of the tools and understanding and appreciation of, 00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:04,000
一些工具和理解和欣赏，
--of what the requirements are for assignments as they come along. 00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:08,840
任务出现时的要求是什么。
--And I, I think we tried that last year when I, as a, 00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:15,520
而我，我认为我们去年尝试过，当时我，
--last year with this course, and I think the students found it fairly helpful. 00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:19,160
去年学习了这门课程，我认为学生们发现它很有帮助。
--So we'll do some form of that as well. 00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:21,760
所以我们也会做某种形式的。
--So the idea is we're not going to present new material but it will be stuff that 00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:27,440
所以我们的想法是我们不会展示新材料，但它会是那些
--kind of helps move you along and gets you oriented with the assignments better. 00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:31,360
有点帮助你前进，让你更好地适应任务。
--Oops, I lost a few words there. 00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:36,600
哎呀，我在那里漏掉了几句话。
--Last two weeks, you'll see there aren't any classes. 00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:40,040
过去两周，您会看到没有任何课程。
--What we're trying to do is kind of get through the lecture material so 00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:44,280
我们要做的是通读一下讲座材料，这样
--that in time for you to kind of get your projects figured out, 00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:50,240
及时让你弄清楚你的项目，
--that some of which will be based on the lecture material. 00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:52,960
其中一些将基于讲座材料。
--And also to kind of open up enough time, 00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:54,880
也为了开放足够的时间，
--because we know how busy students get by the end of the term. 00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:59,080
因为我们知道学生在学期末有多忙。
--And because our expectation is you'll really put quite an effort into 00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:03,720
因为我们的期望是你真的会付出很多努力
--these projects, and we want to make sure that you have the time to do that. 00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:08,040
这些项目，我们希望确保您有时间去做。
--You'll see in the schedule that there's multiple checkpoints on that project too, 00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:12,880
你会在时间表中看到该项目也有多个检查点，
--that we plan to kind of actively track your, your progress in that so 00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:17,480
我们计划积极跟踪您在这方面的进展
--that you don't make the mistake of delaying to the last week of classes. 00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:21,880
你不会犯延迟到最后一周上课的错误。
--Then trying through an all-nighter to do a, 00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:25,320
然后尝试通宵达旦地做一个，
--a project that's just not possible in a course like this. 00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:29,000
在这样的课程中不可能完成的项目。
--So we, we want to make the project be a, a, a big success for you. 00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:33,600
所以我们，我们想让这个项目对你来说是一个，一个，巨大的成功。
--And something that you remember years afterwards as 00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:39,280
多年后你还记得的东西
--something that was a, a really great experience for you. 00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:42,040
这对你来说是一次非常棒的体验。
--Okay, so the one last part I want to talk about is the sort of 00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:50,200
好的，所以我想谈的最后一部分是
--thing we don't like to talk about, which is what do we consider valid and 00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:54,880
我们不喜欢谈论的事情，这是我们认为有效和
--invalid types of in, collaboration. 00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:58,520
无效类型的合作。
--And again, there's a, a, a web page description of this. 00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:03,000
再一次，有一个网页描述。
--There's a it's in the syllabus and it's, 00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:08,840
教学大纲中有一个，它是，
--there's nothing unusual about what we say here, but we want, 00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:11,920
我们在这里说的话并没有什么不寻常的，但我们想要，
--I want to emphasize that we really mean it. 00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:14,520
我想强调的是，我们是认真的。
--And so in particular, this is a course where you do kind of want to talk to each 00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:22,960
特别是，在这门课程中，你确实有点想与每个人交谈
--other, and, and really that's okay if you're talking sort of high level ideas 00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:28,680
其他，而且，如果你谈论的是高层次的想法，那真的没关系
--about gee, I'm trying to figure out if I should do it in parallel this way or 00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:35,520
关于 gee，我想弄清楚我是否应该以这种方式并行进行，或者
--that way kind of questions. 00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:36,840
那样的问题。
--But we don't want you like sharing anything that would be related to the details of 00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:42,560
但我们不希望您喜欢分享任何与以下细节相关的内容
--how you actually then arrived at your implementation. 00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:46,960
你实际上是如何到达你的实现的。
--Code or, you know, performance data or, you know, helping each other, 00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:53,360
代码，或者，你知道的，性能数据，或者，你知道的，互相帮助，
--figuring out bugs, all those things. 00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:58,120
找出错误，所有这些事情。
--Just, you can't, we, we won't let you do that. 00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:00,440
只是，你不能，我们，我们不会让你那样做。
--That's really not good. 00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:02,320
那可真不好。
--The other is, there's a lot of, we, a lot of the material for 00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:06,520
另一个是，有很多，我们，很多材料
--this course and a lot of the resources you want are on the web. 00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:10,320
本课程和您需要的许多资源都在网上。
--Companies like Intel and Nvidia have lots of web pages and 00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:14,360
像 Intel 和 Nvidia 这样的公司有很多网页和
--data and we want you to make use of that. 00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:17,440
数据，我们希望您能利用它。
--There's a lot of good stuff on Stack Overflow. 00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:20,680
 Stack Overflow 上有很多好东西。
--A lot of references on people's blogs. 00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:23,920
人们的博客上有很多参考资料。
--The web is full of material and, and for all of us who do this kind of work, 00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:30,040
网络上充满了材料，对于我们所有从事此类工作的人来说，
--we're just pounding the web all the time trying to track down how do I do X, Y, or 00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:35,200
我们只是一直在搜索网络，试图追踪我如何做 X、Y 或
--Z, or what's the documentation on this and you know where can I find out more about 00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:41,120
Z，或者这方面的文档是什么，你知道我在哪里可以找到更多关于
--that, so it's a really important tool and we want to fully encourage you to use it. 00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:46,160
因此，它是一个非常重要的工具，我们希望全力鼓励您使用它。
--On the other hand, working out there on people's GitHub accounts, 00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:52,720
另一方面，在人们的 GitHub 帐户上锻炼，
--are copies of assignments fully formed and just that's way out of line. 00:21:52,720 --> 00:22:02,560
是完全形成的作业副本，这太过分了。
--If, if you're looking at anything that's sort of related to some instance of 00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:07,000
如果，如果你正在查看与某些实例相关的任何内容
--this course now or before, then that's really not not allowed. 00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:14,560
这门课现在还是以前，那可真不行。
--And you're really harming yourself a lot if you start trying to look for 00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:18,440
如果你开始尝试寻找，你真的会伤害自己很多
--people's solutions because this, and I'll, I'll tell you, it's frustrating. 00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:23,840
人们的解决方案，因为这个，我会，我会告诉你，这很令人沮丧。
--I'll tell you from first hand experience, 00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:25,680
我用亲身经历告诉你，
--doing this kind of stuff is frustrating. 00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:27,520
做这种事情是令人沮丧的。
--My experience in, in doing the labs is, I'd try something that I thought was 00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:33,920
我做实验室的经验是，我会尝试一些我认为是
--really great, it was actually slower doing it on a parallel computer than just on one. 00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:40,000
真的很棒，实际上在并行计算机上执行它比在一台计算机上执行要慢。
--And then I'd pound and pound and pound, I'd get it so it was the same speed. 00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:44,360
然后我会敲打，敲打，我会得到它，所以它是相同的速度。
--And then I'd pound and pound and pound, and then it was twice as fast. 00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:48,160
然后我会砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰砰速度快了一倍。
--And then on click, boom, there it goes 20 times faster. 00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:52,160
然后点击一下，砰的一声，速度快了 20 倍。
--So it's a, a kind of thing where you can't measure your progress in some linear form. 00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:58,200
所以这是一种你无法以某种线性形式衡量你的进步的事情。
--It's things happen, you have a great idea but it turns out not to work. 00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:02,680
事情发生了，你有一个好主意，但结果却行不通。
--And then you think about another idea. 00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:05,640
然后你考虑另一个想法。
--And this is the way you learn this material is by, by doing it. 00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:09,480
这就是您通过实践来学习该材料的方式。
--You can be, we can guide you and help you along and 00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:13,120
你可以，我们可以指导你，帮助你，
--try and avoid some of the dead ends or bad ideas. 00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:15,920
尽量避免一些死胡同或坏主意。
--But to a large extent, this is stuff you have to learn to be able to do on your own. 00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:20,080
但在很大程度上，这是你必须学习才能独立完成的事情。
--Because that's the way it's going to be as you go out into the world. 00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:23,440
因为这就是你走向世界的方式。
--So don't start looking for GitHub accounts. 00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:29,120
所以不要开始寻找 GitHub 帐户。
--And similarly it's I said there's a GitHub accounts with this stuff on it. 00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:37,920
类似地，我说过有一个 GitHub 帐户上面有这些东西。
--But that doesn't mean we like it. 00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:39,360
但这并不意味着我们喜欢它。
--So in particular, we consider that. 00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:42,000
因此，我们特别考虑了这一点。
--And we're being more strict about this in other courses as well. 00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,600
我们在其他课程中也对此更加严格。
--But if you provide this material to some future student, either explicitly or 00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:51,360
但是如果你把这些材料提供给未来的学生，无论是明确的还是
--inadvertently because you left it on a GitHub account, because you're trying to 00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:55,240
无意中因为你把它留在了 GitHub 帐户上，因为你正试图
--get a job, and the company you were interviewing with said, 00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:59,640
找到一份工作，你面试的公司说，
--we'd like to look at your code, could you make it available? 00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:02,560
我们想看看你的代码，你能提供吗？
--You say, sure, it's on GitHub, take a look. 00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:07,000
你说，当然，它在 GitHub 上，你看看。
--This if this sounds like it might have actually happened, 00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:11,080
如果这听起来像是真的发生过，
--it's because it's happened many times. 00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:13,400
这是因为它发生了很多次。
--And so that's a case where you are making material available to future students 00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:19,080
所以在这种情况下，您正在为未来的学生提供材料
--that we consider an academic integrity violation. 00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:23,200
我们认为违反学术诚信。
--So we can, and we will, 00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:27,160
所以我们可以，而且我们会，
--actually go after former students when they violate that policy. 00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:32,400
当他们违反该政策时，实际上会追捕以前的学生。
--And we've done that a little bit, not for this course, but for other courses. 00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:37,200
我们已经做了一点，不是为了这门课程，而是为了其他课程。
--And we collectively, meaning the faculty, intend to be more strict about that now. 00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:43,240
我们集体，也就是教职员工，打算现在对此更加严格。
--So it's sort of your obligation to keep your own 00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:48,720
所以保留自己的东西是你的义务
--information in a way that won't be accessed by future students. 00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:52,920
以未来学生无法访问的方式获取信息。
--So that's sort of the not fun part of the course, this part, but 00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:56,920
所以这是课程中不太有趣的部分，这部分，但是
--it's an important part to understand. 00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:59,320
这是理解的重要部分。
--So I'm going to pause now and be glad to answer a few questions. 00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:04,920
所以我现在要暂停一下，很高兴回答几个问题。
--And then after that, I'm going to hand it over to Todd, 00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:07,280
在那之后，我要把它交给托德，
--who is actually going to talk about parallel computing. 00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:10,160
谁真正要谈论并行计算。
--Whereas I was just talking about logistics. 00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:12,560
而我只是在谈论物流。
--Questions, yes? 00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:13,440
问题，是吗？
--So you're applying to an auto lab? 00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:16,600
所以你申请汽车实验室？
--You don't need auto, no one's enrolled in auto lab yet. 00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:20,280
你不需要汽车，还没有人注册汽车实验室。
--Soon, all the registered students will be in auto lab. 00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:23,440
很快，所有注册的学生都将进入汽车实验室。
--In any case, you do not need an auto lab account to do this assignment. 00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:29,720
在任何情况下，您都不需要汽车实验室帐户来完成此任务。
--If you're a registered student, you'll turn it in via auto lab. 00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:32,680
如果您是注册学生，您将通过自动实验室将其上交。
--If you're a wait-listed student, there's a program included in 00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:40,520
如果您是候补学生，则有一个程序包含在
--the course starter code that will copy it into a file on AFS, 00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:50,000
将其复制到 AFS 上的文件中的课程入门代码，
--to which you have write-only access. 00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,360
您对其具有只写访问权限。
--So that's a long version of the short story is, we've set up a way for 00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:58,680
所以这是短篇小说的长篇版本，我们已经建立了一种方法
--unregistered students to do the work in this first assignment and 00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:02,560
未注册的学生完成第一项作业中的工作，并且
--submit it without having to make use of auto lab. 00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:05,160
无需使用汽车实验室即可提交。
--Other questions? 00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:07,880
其他问题？
--Yes? 00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:09,960
是的？
--Does the GitHub policy also include the final project? 00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:13,120
 GitHub 政策是否也包括最终项目？
--Pardon? 00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:13,760
赦免？
--Does the GitHub making code accessible, 00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:17,360
 GitHub 是否使代码易于访问，
--does that also include the final project? 00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:21,320
这也包括最终项目吗？
--No, no, no. 00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:23,160
不不不。
--No, that's an interesting question. 00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:28,520
不，这是一个有趣的问题。
--I'll make sure that's clarified, but offhand, no, I don't think that. 00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:32,760
我会确保这一点得到澄清，但顺便说一句，不，我不这么认为。
--We expect people on the projects to be doing original, 00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:36,920
我们希望项目中的人做原创的，
--projects that are original to them. 00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:38,160
他们原创的项目。
--Yes? 00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:39,760
是的？
--Is this class is graded on a curve? 00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:43,720
这门课是按曲线评分的吗？
--Somewhat, yes. 00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:44,520
有点，是的。
--Not a strict curve, like it's not like we have a quota that says, hm? 00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:49,480
不是严格的曲线，就像我们没有配额说的那样，嗯？
--We couldn't hear the question in the back, could you repeat the question? 00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:51,440
我们听不到后面的问题，你能重复这个问题吗？
--The question is, is this class graded on a curve? 00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:54,720
问题是，这门课是按曲线评分的吗？
--The answer is a little bit, meaning that, and 00:26:55,720 --> 00:27:00,600
答案有点，意思是，和
--actually the whole grading is a little open ended. 00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:06,960
实际上整个分级有点开放式。
--Part of it is, for example, the assignments three and 00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:09,360
例如，其中一部分是作业三和
--four that we're going to hand out have never been done before. 00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:13,080
我们要分发的四个以前从未做过。
--And so we don't actually know what the grades are going to be like. 00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:16,240
所以我们实际上并不知道成绩会怎样。
--And so we have to be willing to adapt based on, 00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:20,760
所以我们必须愿意根据，
--you'll be trying out some problems that we've never had students try to solve before. 00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:26,440
您将尝试一些我们以前从未让学生尝试解决的问题。
--On the other hand, we don't have a quota. 00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:29,080
另一方面，我们没有配额。
--We don't have to say there's gotta be this many A's, this many B's, 00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:32,800
我们不必说必须有这么多的 A，这么多的 B，
--this many C's, and so forth. 00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:34,080
这么多 C，等等。
--So we're not a curve in the sense of we've got a target and we have to get it. 00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:38,600
所以我们不是曲线，因为我们有一个目标，我们必须达到它。
--We do it more by a little bit of a judgment call on where we think the, 00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:43,720
我们更多地通过对我们认为的地方进行判断来做到这一点，
--you know, the standard should be toward the end of the term. 00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:45,960
你知道，标准应该在学期末。
--Questions? 00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:48,800
问题？
--Yes. 00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:54,560
是的。
--So for the first assignment, can we get feedback for 00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:58,960
那么对于第一个任务，我们能得到反馈吗？
--our, you know, for how we're doing on the first assignment? 00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:02,160
我们，你知道，我们在第一个任务上的表现如何？
--So usually with AutoLab and some, you know, some courses you can submit, 00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:05,960
所以通常使用 AutoLab 和一些，你知道的，一些你可以提交的课程，
--you know, one assignment multiple times. 00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:08,120
你知道，一个任务多次。
--Yes. 00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:09,160
是的。
--So I'm wondering. 00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:09,920
所以我想知道。
--There's no auto grading. 00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:11,960
没有自动评分。
--You'll, you'll know, if you look at the assignment, there's it gives you, 00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:16,880
你会，你会知道，如果你看作业，它会给你，
--you know, there's really, the assignment is 00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:19,200
你知道，真的，任务是
--an extremely small amount of writing your own code. 00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:23,720
极少量的编写自己的代码。
--You're actually just gonna be editing some files. 00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:26,640
你实际上只是要编辑一些文件。
--And much more running, measuring, and 00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:30,720
还有更多的跑步、测量和
--explaining the results of those measurements. 00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:34,840
解释这些测量的结果。
--So the, in this first assignment we care much more about what you say. 00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:41,480
所以，在第一个任务中，我们更关心你说的是什么。
--Then what your code looks like. 00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:43,720
那么你的代码是什么样的。
--And so the larger part of this assignment, 00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:45,960
所以这个任务的大部分，
--what you'll be turning in is a document. 00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:48,440
你要上交的是一份文件。
--Documenting your findings on five different problems. 00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:52,200
记录您对五个不同问题的发现。
--So there's no auto grading. 00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:54,640
所以没有自动分级。
--On the other hand, you know, the parts we say, 00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:57,560
另一方面，你知道，我们说的部分，
--see if you can make this code run eight times faster than the serial version. 00:28:57,560 --> 00:29:03,400
看看你能否使这段代码的运行速度比串行版本快八倍。
--Well, you'll know if it's running eight times faster, 00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:06,160
好吧，如果它的运行速度快了八倍，你就会知道，
--because it will come back with these numbers. 00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:07,880
因为它会返回这些数字。
--So you'll have a pretty good sense of how you're doing as you go. 00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:13,000
所以你会很清楚自己在做什么。
--It's not just a total black box. 00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
它不仅仅是一个完全的黑盒子。
--I guess I'll say one thing related to that, which is compared to 213, 00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:20,760
我想我会说一件与此相关的事情，与 213 相比，
--this course is very different because in this class, 00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:23,920
这门课程非常不同，因为在这门课上，
--we'll be doing a lot of performance debugging and tuning. 00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:27,360
我们正在进行大量的性能调试和调整。
--So what we care about is not just, like in 213, for 00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:31,720
所以我们关心的不仅仅是像 213 中那样
--some of the labs, you may have the right answer. 00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:33,920
一些实验室，你可能有正确的答案。
--So you get the right answer, you get full credit. 00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:36,360
所以你得到正确的答案，你就得到了满分。
--In this class, we want you to get good performance, but 00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:39,000
在这节课上，我们希望你取得好成绩，但是
--what we, but that almost always involves trying several things that didn't 00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:43,040
我们所做的，但这几乎总是涉及尝试一些没有的事情
--actually work very well, learning from why they didn't work very well, and 00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:47,520
实际上工作得很好，从他们工作得不好的原因中学习，并且
--reasoning about how you're gonna do it the next time. 00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:50,960
思考下一次你要怎么做。
--And so when you write up your assignment, we really care about you describing that 00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:55,720
所以当你写下你的作业时，我们真的很关心你的描述
--whole process that you went through, where you iteratively tried something, 00:29:55,720 --> 00:30:00,000
你经历的整个过程，你反复尝试的地方，
--it didn't work very well, you figured out why, and then you tried something else. 00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:04,640
它效果不佳，您弄清楚了原因，然后尝试了其他方法。
--So this is, you know, performance debugging and 00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:06,760
所以这是，你知道，性能调试和
--tuning is a big theme in this course. 00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:09,440
调整是本课程的一个大主题。
--And it's very different probably from any other class you've taken before. 00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:13,320
它可能与您之前上过的任何其他课程都大不相同。
--Right. 00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:14,240
正确的。
--And as a result, it's not, there's not a lot of, there's not autograding, really. 00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:18,600
结果，它不是，没有很多，没有自动评分，真的。
--Yeah, nothing in this class. 00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:20,760
是的，这堂课什么都没有。
--But I think that's a, the question's good, and 00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:23,440
但我认为这是一个，这个问题很好，而且
--I think what Todd said is quite useful. 00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:25,960
我认为托德说的很有用。
--Yes? 00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:26,480
是的？
--So for example, since there's a write-up, so 00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:30,840
例如，因为有一篇文章，所以
--there's no way we can get feedback on kind of like what we're thinking. 00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:34,320
我们无法就我们的想法获得反馈。
--Because basically there's only like we have a big. 00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:37,160
因为基本上只有像我们有一个大的。
--Yep. 00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:37,680
是的。
--So I know it's gonna be hard, and 00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:43,360
所以我知道这会很难，而且
--you're gonna have to do stuff for which we haven't had lectures on. 00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:46,440
你将不得不做一些我们没有上过课的事情。
--I'm not saying this is an easy way to handle it, but 00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:49,760
我并不是说这是处理它的简单方法，但是
--it's how we're gonna handle it, and that's just the way it is. 00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:52,240
这就是我们要处理的方式，这就是它的方式。
--Let me comment for a minute. 00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:53,320
让我评论一下。
--I think what Todd said there is extremely important understanding what you wanna do 00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:58,200
我认为托德所说的对理解你想做什么非常重要
--here. 00:30:58,200 --> 00:30:58,920
这里。
--The course is about the journey to optimization, 00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:01,120
该课程是关于优化之旅，
--not simply whether it's fast enough. 00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:03,480
不仅仅是它是否足够快。
--So it's not about simply having the fastest solution. 00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:06,680
所以这不仅仅是拥有最快的解决方案。
--It's about making the mistakes and learning to reason about them. 00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:09,880
这是关于犯错误并学会对错误进行推理。
--The optimization is almost always a process. 00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:11,760
优化几乎总是一个过程。
--These systems are really complicated. 00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:13,920
这些系统真的很复杂。
--And very few, if anybody, can look at a system and say, 00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:16,760
很少有人，如果有人的话，可以看着一个系统说，
--this is how we're gonna do this for perfect performance the first time. 00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:19,680
这就是我们第一次要达到完美性能的方式。
--In the real world, that doesn't happen. 00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:21,240
在现实世界中，这不会发生。
--You take your best guesses, you make your best estimates, 00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:23,200
你做出最好的猜测，做出最好的估计，
--you come up with a strategy, you try it, you performance measure the heck out of it. 00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:27,720
你想出了一个策略，你尝试了它，你的绩效衡量了它。
--You figure out where you're spending your time. 00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:29,520
你弄清楚你把时间花在哪里了。
--You figure out why you're spending your time. 00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:30,840
你弄清楚你为什么要花时间。
--You figure out where your mental model differs from the real world model. 00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:33,800
你找出你的心智模型与现实世界模型的不同之处。
--And you try to bring your model to the heart of it. 00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:36,120
你试着把你的模型带到它的核心。
--And then you try something else, 00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:37,640
然后你尝试别的东西，
--having refined your understanding of what's going on, the dynamics of the system. 00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:40,720
完善了您对正在发生的事情以及系统动态的理解。
--Because it's a matter of what the hardware is doing, and 00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:44,480
因为这是硬件在做什么的问题，而且
--the dynamics of how the software is executing. 00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:46,080
软件如何执行的动态。
--And so in terms of, you're gonna get constant feedback in this class, 00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:52,040
因此，就此而言，你会在这门课上得到持续的反馈，
--just like you can do. 00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:53,320
就像你能做的一样。
--Every time you run it, you're gonna get numbers back. 00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:55,480
每次你运行它，你都会得到数字。
--They're gonna tell you immediately whether you've made progress or not. 00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:58,160
他们会立即告诉你是否取得了进展。
--So your goal is to look at this and say, I think if I do this, 00:31:58,160 --> 00:32:00,200
所以你的目标是看看这个然后说，我想如果我这样做，
--I'm gonna see a performance improvement of x. 00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:02,720
我会看到 x 的性能改进。
--The system comes back and tells you, you have a performance improvement of y. 00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:06,280
系统返回并告诉您，您的性能提高了 y。
--That performance improvement could be better than you expected or 00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:08,280
性能改进可能比您预期的要好，或者
--worse than you expected. 00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:09,680
比你预期的还要糟糕。
--In either case, you want to understand why. 00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:12,280
无论哪种情况，您都想了解原因。
--If it turned out to be twice as fast as you expected, 00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:14,720
如果它的速度是你预期的两倍，
--you don't simply want to say yes and move on. 00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:16,840
您不只是想说“是”然后继续前进。
--You want to understand, why was it twice as fast as I expected? 00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:20,640
你想明白，为什么比我预期的快一倍？
--Because you're learning in that order. 00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:23,040
因为你是按照那个顺序学习的。
--So it's all about the journey that optimization takes. 00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:25,920
所以这一切都与优化所经历的旅程有关。
--So yes, it's the feedback. 00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:27,840
所以是的，这是反馈。
--But no, we're not gonna provide the stepping stones to get the game. 00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:32,320
但是不，我们不会提供获得游戏的垫脚石。
--I don't think I'll. 00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:36,400
我不认为我会。
--Yes, I think, Greg, your point is, you have a pretty good sense of how you're doing. 00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:42,320
是的，我认为，格雷格，你的意思是，你对自己的表现非常了解。
--The code does sort of do correctness checks, and the code we provide. 00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:47,280
该代码确实进行了正确性检查，我们提供的代码。
--And you know how you're performing, so that's good. 00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:51,120
你知道自己的表现如何，这很好。
--I think the point you made is, especially on this first assignment, 00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:55,120
我认为你的意思是，尤其是在第一项任务中，
--it's a little open-ended what our expectations are and what the standards will be. 00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:58,920
我们的期望和标准有点开放。
--And that's just the harsh reality of this situation we're in, 00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:05,240
这就是我们所处情况的严酷现实，
--where we have a very limited number of spots to go. 00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:07,440
我们可以去的景点数量非常有限。
--One more question. 00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:11,440
还有一个问题。
--Is it typical that we actually make a very accurate estimate of how fast it will come? 00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:15,800
我们实际上对它的到来速度做出非常准确的估计是典型的吗？
--Or will there be like lots of variables after they get to a certain prediction or 00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:20,480
或者在他们得到某个预测之后会有很多变量或者
--something like that? 00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:22,920
像那样的东西？
--There'll be a lot of things where it's hard to figure out why it's doing what it's doing. 00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:26,480
会有很多事情很难弄清楚为什么它正在做它正在做的事情。
--Some of that you'll figure out, some of it you'll just write off the well, 00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:31,200
其中一些你会弄清楚，其中一些你只会注销井，
--there's mysteries to this. 00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:34,600
这其中有玄机。
--Yeah, stay tuned for next week's lectures. 00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:36,240
是的，敬请期待下周的讲座。
--Okay, so hi, everybody. 00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:41,520
好的，大家好。
--I'm Todd Mowery, and as Randy said, I've taught this course many times. 00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:46,440
我是 Todd Mowery，正如 Randy 所说，我已经多次教授这门课程。
--It's one of my favorite courses. 00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:48,120
这是我最喜欢的课程之一。
--And what I'm gonna talk about now is, I'm gonna start off with a little bit of a, 00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:52,480
我现在要说的是，我将从一点点开始，
--oh, interesting, this is not working anymore. 00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:56,360
哦，有趣的是，这不再起作用了。
--That's fun. 00:33:57,280 --> 00:33:58,320
好好玩。
--All right, let's see if it wakes up. 00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:00,280
好吧，让我们看看它是否醒来。
--All right, we'll do that. 00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:01,120
好吧，我们会这样做的。
--Okay, so I'm gonna talk a little bit about parallel processing in the past, 00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:08,720
好的，所以我要谈谈过去的并行处理，
--and how we got to where we are today with parallel processing, 00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:11,760
以及我们如何通过并行处理到达今天的位置，
--because things have changed over time. 00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:14,600
因为随着时间的推移，事情已经发生了变化。
--I'm just opening up the little remote on my phone, so I can control it this way. 00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:17,600
我只是打开手机上的小遥控器，所以我可以用这种方式控制它。
--Okay, so parallel processing is not a new thing. 00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:23,440
好的，并行处理并不是什么新鲜事。
--It's been around for a number of decades. 00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:26,240
它已经存在了几十年。
--And it originated because there were people who had really, 00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:31,480
它的起源是因为有人真的，
--really high needs for fast computing. 00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:34,520
对快速计算的真正高需求。
--For example, physicists who were trying to simulate physical things, 00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:40,840
例如，试图模拟物理事物的物理学家，
--where they need lots and lots of data, and they need to compute 00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:43,960
他们需要大量的数据，他们需要计算
--solutions to differential equations over lots of time steps. 00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:48,120
许多时间步长的微分方程的解。
--And in fact, some of these people work in government labs that have 00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:52,400
事实上，其中一些人在政府实验室工作
--very large budgets. 00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:53,600
非常大的预算。
--So they need lots of performance, and they have lots of money. 00:34:53,640 --> 00:34:56,640
所以他们需要很多表现，而且他们有很多钱。
--So people started building machines that were very fast, 00:34:56,640 --> 00:35:01,320
所以人们开始制造速度非常快的机器，
--using multiple processors. 00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:03,440
使用多个处理器。
--And in fact, one of the first parallel machines was built here at CMU, 00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:08,840
事实上，第一台并行机就是在 CMU 建造的，
--the C.MMP, and I think the carcass of it is actually somewhere in Wien Hall, 00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:14,320
 C.MMP，我认为它的尸体实际上在 Wien Hall 的某个地方，
--I believe. 00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:15,760
我相信。
--But that was a machine that had a number of different, had 16 processors in it. 00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:21,120
但那是一台有许多不同的机器，里面有 16 个处理器。
--Then another very well-known example, in the 80s, 00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:24,400
然后另一个非常著名的例子，在 80 年代，
--there was a guy named Seymour Cray who designed supercomputers 00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:29,160
有一个叫 Seymour Cray 的人设计了超级计算机
--using vector processing, which we'll talk about next week, but also multiple CPUs. 00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:34,920
使用矢量处理，我们将在下周讨论，还有多个 CPU。
--So his machines were very expensive and very fast. 00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:37,800
所以他的机器非常昂贵而且速度非常快。
--They had a relatively small number of processors, but 00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:40,760
他们的处理器数量相对较少，但是
--each of them was very, very fast. 00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:43,000
他们每个人都非常非常快。
--And then there was a startup company out of MIT called Thinking Machines. 00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:47,600
然后麻省理工学院有一家名为 Thinking Machines 的创业公司。
--And their machines were designed very differently. 00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:51,960
他们的机器设计非常不同。
--Their approach was to have lots and lots of very wimpy little processors. 00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:57,680
他们的方法是拥有很多很多非常弱的小处理器。
--So for example, they had 65,000 single bit processors in one of their 00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:02,960
因此，例如，他们的其中一个中有 65,000 个单位处理器
--early machines. 00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:04,280
早期的机器。
--They were also really good at making machines with lots of blinky lights, 00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:07,920
他们也非常擅长制造带有大量闪烁灯的机器，
--which make for nice demos. 00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:09,480
这使得很好的演示。
--And they're good in science fiction movies, 00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:11,560
他们擅长科幻电影，
--when people wanna see the computer doing something. 00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:13,280
当人们想看到计算机做某事时。
--Okay, still not working, that's fine. 00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:17,040
好吧，还是不行，没关系。
--All right, so originally, it was like a scientist thing. 00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:24,680
好吧，原来，这就像科学家的事情。
--You know what, I can also make this thing control it, so I'll do that. 00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:27,400
你知道吗，我也可以让这东西控制它，所以我会那样做。
--Cool. 00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:29,420
凉爽的。
--All right, maybe not. 00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:31,520
好吧，也许不是。
--Sorry. 00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:34,000
对不起。
--All this technology. 00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,120
所有这些技术。
--All right, there we go. 00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:39,360
好吧，我们开始吧。
--Oh well. 00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:40,160
那好吧。
--Okay, so originally it was all about scientific computing. 00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:43,760
好吧，原来这一切都是关于科学计算的。
--And those people still use these machines. 00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:47,000
那些人仍在使用这些机器。
--But the next thing in the evolution of this type of machine was that in the 1990s, 00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:53,360
但是这种机器的下一步发展是在 1990 年代，
--the database people figured out that parallel machines were a really good way 00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:57,680
数据库人员发现并行机是一个非常好的方法
--to do transaction processing very quickly. 00:36:57,680 --> 00:37:00,880
非常快速地进行事务处理。
--They figured out how to take all the important algorithms and 00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:04,440
他们想出了如何将所有重要的算法和
--data structures and databases and spread them out across multiple processors. 00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:09,160
数据结构和数据库，并将它们分布在多个处理器上。
--And this was really good for online transaction processing. 00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:13,720
这对于在线交易处理非常有用。
--So for example, with the web, and 00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:17,160
例如，通过网络，以及
--there are databases that are running the back end of websites and things like that. 00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:21,840
有运行网站后端的数据库等等。
--So for example, Oracle sold lots of machines that ran databases. 00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:29,000
例如，甲骨文出售了很多运行数据库的机器。
--And so Sun Microsystems did, and then Oracle is a big database company, and 00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:33,800
所以 Sun Microsystems 做到了，然后 Oracle 是一家大型数据库公司，并且
--they recently bought, somewhat recently bought Sun. 00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:38,400
他们最近买了，最近买了 Sun。
--So okay, so that's what was going on. 00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:41,480
好吧，这就是发生的事情。
--So the reason why that was interesting was that 00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:45,160
所以这很有趣的原因是
--databases is a bigger market than scientific computing. 00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:49,280
数据库是一个比科学计算更大的市场。
--So suddenly these things were becoming more interesting as an actual business. 00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:53,840
所以突然间，这些事情作为一项实际业务变得更加有趣。
--Okay, now before I talk about how we ended up where we are today, 00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:57,280
好吧，在我谈论我们是如何走到今天这一步之前，
--the next thing I wanna talk about a little bit is what was going on with 00:37:57,280 --> 00:38:01,120
接下来我想谈的是发生了什么事
--just general microprocessors over time. 00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:04,920
随着时间的推移，只是一般的微处理器。
--So up until, so this is before your time. 00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:08,800
所以直到，所以这是在你的时间之前。
--But for many decades, 00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:11,280
但是几十年来，
--processors were just getting exponentially faster all the time. 00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:15,600
处理器的速度一直呈指数级增长。
--So they would get, say, something like twice as fast every three years. 00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:20,680
所以他们会得到，比如说，每三年快一倍。
--So in computers, we have lots of these exponential curves. 00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:24,240
所以在计算机中，我们有很多这样的指数曲线。
--Memories get exponentially larger, disks get exponentially larger, and so on. 00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:28,800
内存呈指数级增长，磁盘呈指数级增长，等等。
--So this was another one of these nice exponential curves. 00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:32,200
所以这是这些漂亮的指数曲线中的另一条。
--And what was making it get fast? 00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:35,120
是什么让它变快了？
--What was behind this? 00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:37,160
这背后是什么？
--Well, one thing that was making processors get faster was that they had 00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:42,200
好吧，让处理器变得更快的一件事是他们有
--wider data paths. 00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:43,880
更宽的数据路径。
--So again, this is sort of ancient history at this point, but 00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:46,840
所以，这又是一段古老的历史，但是
--long ago their processors just had operated on four bits of data at a time. 00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:51,360
很久以前，他们的处理器一次只能处理四位数据。
--Then they went to eight, 16, 32, 64 bits. 00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:55,320
然后他们去了 8、16、32、64 位。
--Now the jump from 16 to 32 was a big deal in terms of improving performance. 00:38:55,320 --> 00:39:00,640
现在，从 16 位跳到 32 位在提高性能方面意义重大。
--32 to 64, much less so. 00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:03,680
 32 到 64，更不用说了。
--Most people can get away with 8 billion bytes of memory. 00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:09,480
大多数人可以拥有 80 亿字节的内存。
--Machines didn't even have that much memory back then. 00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:12,600
那时机器甚至没有那么多内存。
--So that was one of the things that helped a bit. 00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:15,320
所以这是有点帮助的事情之一。
--But another thing that helped a lot was that in the 80s and 90s, 00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:19,240
但另一件很有帮助的事情是在 80 年代和 90 年代，
--processor designers figured out much more streamlined ways of designing pipelines. 00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:25,160
处理器设计人员想出了更加精简的流水线设计方法。
--So that as the instructions are flowing through the processor, 00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:29,200
这样当指令流经处理器时，
--they could be more and more efficient. 00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:30,800
他们可以变得越来越有效率。
--They made everything nice and regular. 00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:33,280
他们让一切都变得美好而规律。
--And this helped reduce the amount of time that it took to execute each instruction 00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:37,960
这有助于减少执行每条指令所花费的时间
--down from, say, about three and a half cycles for 00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:41,440
比方说，大约三个半周期
--every instruction down to something close to one cycle per instruction. 00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:45,720
每条指令都接近每条指令的一个周期。
--So the next step after that is they wanted to go beyond that point, 00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:53,520
所以在那之后的下一步是他们想要超越那一点，
--and they started having processors execute multiple instructions simultaneously. 00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:58,440
他们开始让处理器同时执行多条指令。
--And this is still happening today. 00:39:58,440 --> 00:39:59,960
这在今天仍在发生。
--And the idea is that the hardware is trying to look ahead in the instruction stream and 00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:05,480
这个想法是硬件试图在指令流中向前看并且
--find independent instructions, instructions that don't depend on each other. 00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:09,640
找到独立的指令，不相互依赖的指令。
--And if it finds them, it may be able to issue, say, 00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:12,360
如果找到它们，它可能会发出，比如说，
--up to four of them simultaneously. 00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:15,800
最多同时有四个。
--So this also helped performance, especially in the 90s. 00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:19,600
所以这也有助于提高性能，尤其是在 90 年代。
--Okay. 00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:21,380
好的。
--But really, the big thing that was helping more than anything else 00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:27,720
但实际上，最重要的事情比其他任何事情都更有帮助
--was that clock rates were getting faster. 00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:30,400
是时钟速率越来越快。
--So the clock rate, there's a little crystal that's causing the processor 00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:35,480
所以时钟速率，有一个小晶体导致处理器
--to step through whatever it's doing in the hardware. 00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:39,040
逐步了解它在硬件中所做的一切。
--And the clock rates were also increasing exponentially. 00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:42,440
并且时钟速率也呈指数增长。
--So for example, in the early 90s, processors ran at about 10 megahertz or so. 00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:48,720
例如，在 90 年代初期，处理器的运行频率约为 10 兆赫兹左右。
--And then through the 90s, Intel had a huge marketing campaign 00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:53,040
然后到了 90 年代，英特尔开展了一场大规模的营销活动
--teaching everybody that performance equals clock rate. 00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:56,680
教大家性能等于时钟频率。
--So they taught grandma, all consumers, 00:40:56,680 --> 00:40:59,800
所以他们教导奶奶，所有的消费者，
--that your 100 megahertz processor is garbage now, 00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:03,640
你的 100 兆赫兹处理器现在是垃圾，
--because our new 200 megahertz processor has come out. 00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:06,680
因为我们新的200兆赫处理器已经问世了。
--So you really need to go upgrade to the new 200 megahertz Pentium whatever. 00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:12,200
所以你真的需要升级到新的 200 兆赫奔腾。
--So for a long time, clock rate was really driving performance. 00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:17,120
所以很长一段时间以来，时钟速率真正推动了性能。
--But then something happened. 00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:19,000
但后来发生了一些事情。
--So to give you, there was a little bit of foreshadowing of this problem. 00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:24,920
所以给你，这个问题有点伏笔。
--So for example, Pat Gelsinger, he was the CTO of Intel before. 00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:31,400
所以比如说Pat Gelsinger，他之前是Intel的CTO。
--He's currently the CEO of VMware. 00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:36,840
他目前是 VMware 的首席执行官。
--But anyway, he gave a talk at a technical conference 00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:40,120
但无论如何，他在一次技术会议上发表了演讲
--before this big event happened, where he was talking about, 00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:43,880
在这件大事发生之前，他正在谈论的地方，
--he gave this slide where he was showing people 00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:47,440
他给了这张幻灯片，他正在向人们展示
--power density numbers for different Intel products. 00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:53,760
不同英特尔产品的功率密度数字。
--So power density is basically on the surface of the chip, 00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:58,360
所以功率密度基本在芯片表面，
--how many watts per square centimeter is it generating? 00:41:58,360 --> 00:42:02,160
它每平方厘米产生多少瓦特？
--And the reason this is important is when that gets hot, 00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:04,800
这很重要的原因是当天气变热时，
--you have to get rid of that heat, otherwise things will melt. 00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:08,440
你必须摆脱那种热量，否则东西会融化。
--So in the early days of Intel processors, you had just a handful of watts. 00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:14,720
所以在英特尔处理器的早期，你只有几瓦。
--So that's not really very hot at all. 00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:16,720
所以这根本不是很热。
--But then he points out that as things are improving exponentially, 00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:24,160
但随后他指出，随着情况呈指数级改善，
--as the clock rate goes up, it turns out that thermal density goes up also. 00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:28,440
随着时钟频率的上升，热密度也会上升。
--So for example, the Intel Pentium, it was hot enough to fry an egg. 00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:34,840
例如，Intel Pentium，它热得可以煎鸡蛋。
--It's a little tiny egg, I guess. 00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:37,520
我猜这是一个很小的蛋。
--But it was as hot as a hot plate. 00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:39,640
但它像电炉一样热。
--So you've probably heard of things called heat sinks. 00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:42,480
所以你可能听说过所谓的散热器。
--So there are these pieces of metal on top of a processor that help dissipate 00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:46,240
所以在处理器顶部有这些金属片可以帮助消散
--the heat from it. 00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:47,480
来自它的热量。
--So that wasn't too bad. 00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:48,520
所以这还不算太糟糕。
--I mean, it's getting a bit hot. 00:42:48,520 --> 00:42:49,680
我的意思是，天气有点热了。
--But looking ahead, he said, okay, clock rates are increasing exponentially, 00:42:51,160 --> 00:42:55,840
但展望未来，他说，好吧，时钟频率呈指数增长，
--but as thermal density starts to continue to increase exponentially, 00:42:55,840 --> 00:43:00,040
但随着热密度开始继续呈指数增长，
--the surface of our chip is going to be as hot as the inside of a nuclear reactor. 00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:04,480
我们芯片的表面会像核反应堆内部一样热。
--That sounds hard, that sounds bad. 00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:07,160
这听起来很难，听起来很糟糕。
--And then we're gonna reach the end of a rocket nozzle, and 00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:10,720
然后我们将到达火箭喷嘴的末端，然后
--then we're on our path to reach the thermal density of the surface of the sun. 00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:15,600
然后我们就走上了达到太阳表面热密度的道路。
--So clearly, something might go wrong there. 00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:19,840
很明显，那里可能出了问题。
--Something did go wrong. 00:43:19,840 --> 00:43:21,280
确实出了点问题。
--So the big news, so this is an article from the New York Times in May 17th, 2004. 00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:28,960
这是个大新闻，所以这是 2004 年 5 月 17 日纽约时报的一篇文章。
--The dramatic event was, so Intel was well aware of this problem. 00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:32,880
戏剧性的事件是，英特尔很清楚这个问题。
--But since they taught everybody that clock rate equals performance, 00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:36,960
但是因为他们告诉每个人时钟速率等于性能，
--they were really hoping to keep riding the clock rate curve. 00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:40,800
他们真的希望继续保持时钟速率曲线。
--But they had to cancel their two flagship projects 00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:44,560
但他们不得不取消他们的两个旗舰项目
--because they could no longer solve the technical problem of how to cool 00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:48,840
因为他们无法再解决如何冷却的技术问题
--these chips without them melting. 00:43:48,840 --> 00:43:50,960
这些芯片没有融化。
--So that was a big deal. 00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:53,200
所以这很重要。
--And I actually happened to be working at Intel at that time. 00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:56,480
而我当时恰好在英特尔工作。
--And so the new world after that is, since we can't make clock rates any faster, 00:43:56,480 --> 00:44:02,400
所以在那之后的新世界是，因为我们不能让时钟频率更快，
--we have to just, what you can do, though, is have multiple cores on a chip. 00:44:03,640 --> 00:44:08,240
但是，我们必须只是，你可以做的是在一个芯片上有多个内核。
--So the world changed overnight. 00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:09,840
于是世界一夜之间变了。
--I know this was when you were in about first grade, so this is long ago. 00:44:09,840 --> 00:44:13,960
我知道那是你大约一年级的时候，所以这是很久以前的事了。
--But that's why today, everything is about multiple cores. 00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:17,640
但这就是为什么今天一切都与多核有关。
--Okay, so if you look at different trends here, for example, clock rate, 00:44:18,760 --> 00:44:24,680
好的，如果你看看这里的不同趋势，例如时钟速率，
--that's this curve, so it was going up exponentially, but it's leveled off. 00:44:24,680 --> 00:44:29,440
这就是这条曲线，所以它呈指数上升，但它已经趋于平稳。
--Instruction level parallelism, that's also leveled off. 00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:32,240
指令级并行性，也已趋于平稳。
--But one thing that has not leveled off is the number of transistors on the chip. 00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:38,440
但有一点没有趋于平稳，那就是芯片上的晶体管数量。
--So we have more and more hardware, but 00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:41,320
所以我们有越来越多的硬件，但是
--we just can't make the individual processors run any faster. 00:44:41,320 --> 00:44:44,160
我们就是不能让单个处理器运行得更快。
--So what we do is we stamp out more and more processors on the chip. 00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:47,440
所以我们所做的就是在芯片上淘汰越来越多的处理器。
--Okay, so what does this mean? 00:44:49,080 --> 00:44:54,760
好的，这是什么意思？
--Probably most of you in the room are more into software and 00:44:54,760 --> 00:44:58,800
可能在场的大多数人都更喜欢软件和
--programming than hardware. 00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:01,240
编程不如硬件。
--So from a software person's perspective, why does this matter? 00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:05,200
所以从软件人员的角度来看，为什么这很重要？
--Well, if you want your software to run fast, in the old days, 00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:10,360
好吧，如果你想让你的软件运行得快，在过去，
--when you were born, say, for example, what you could do back then was, 00:45:10,360 --> 00:45:15,000
例如，当你出生时，你当时可以做的是，
--if you wanted your software to run faster, just wait six months and 00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:18,320
如果你想让你的软件运行得更快，只需等待六个月
--buy a new machine, and the hardware will just run faster, and 00:45:18,320 --> 00:45:22,000
买一台新机器，硬件只会运行得更快，而且
--everything will just be better, so that's great. 00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:25,840
一切都会变得更好，这很好。
--But after 2004, the world changed, and now buying a new machine, 00:45:25,840 --> 00:45:31,080
但是2004年后，世界变了，现在又买了新机器，
--unless you actually change your software to take advantage of multiple cores, 00:45:31,080 --> 00:45:34,880
除非你真的改变你的软件来利用多核，
--it won't run any faster, it'll run at the same speed. 00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:38,360
它不会跑得更快，它会以相同的速度运行。
--So that's why this course is important, 00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:40,320
所以这就是为什么这门课程很重要，
--because we're gonna teach you how to write parallel software. 00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:42,880
因为我们要教你如何编写并行软件。
--Okay, and so you're well aware of this, but every computer today is 00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:49,360
好的，所以你很清楚这一点，但是今天的每台计算机都是
--a parallel computer, ranging from high-end machines all the way down to phones and 00:45:49,360 --> 00:45:55,880
并行计算机，从高端机器一直到电话和
--watches and things like that. 00:45:55,880 --> 00:45:57,880
手表之类的东西。
--So we've got lots and lots of processors today. 00:45:57,880 --> 00:46:00,040
所以我们今天有很多很多的处理器。
--If you look at Apple's product line, this ranges from, say, 00:46:00,040 --> 00:46:03,560
如果你看一下 Apple 的产品线，它的范围包括，比如说，
--ten cores in some of their high-end machines. 00:46:03,560 --> 00:46:07,280
他们的一些高端机器中有十个核心。
--The new phone, the Apple X, I didn't update this here, but it actually has, 00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:12,400
新手机，Apple X，我没有在这里更新，但它确实有，
--so my slightly older phone has two cores in it, and the Apple X, sorry, 00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:17,320
所以我稍旧的手机有两个内核，Apple X，抱歉，
--the iPhone X has six cores in it. 00:46:17,320 --> 00:46:19,400
 iPhone X 有六个内核。
--And your laptops and tablets have lots of cores. 00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:24,080
您的笔记本电脑和平板电脑有很多内核。
--So for example, Intel's processors have a number of CPUs 00:46:24,080 --> 00:46:30,200
所以比如Intel的处理器有多个CPU
--that are just stamped out on the chip. 00:46:30,200 --> 00:46:32,480
只是印在芯片上。
--So for example, this is Skylake, which has a number of CPUs plus 00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:39,200
例如，这是 Skylake，它有许多 CPU 加上
--a GPU, which itself can be used for doing lots of processing. 00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:42,720
GPU，它本身可用于进行大量处理。
--We're gonna talk about that in this course, and 00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:44,480
我们将在本课程中讨论这一点，并且
--you'll be doing that in assignment two. 00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:46,800
你将在作业二中这样做。
--You'll be taking advantage of GPUs. 00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:48,560
您将利用 GPU。
--There's another fun piece of hardware that you'll also be using in this course. 00:46:50,920 --> 00:46:56,600
您还将在本课程中使用另一个有趣的硬件。
--So Intel, Randy talked before about how GPUs are a source of parallel compute 00:46:56,600 --> 00:47:03,560
所以英特尔，Randy 之前谈到了 GPU 如何成为并行计算的来源
--power, but Intel, actually what they did is they took the design of one of their 00:47:03,560 --> 00:47:08,400
权力，但英特尔，实际上他们所做的是他们采用了他们的一个设计
--older, much older generation Pentium machines, Pentium processors, and 00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:13,680
更老的、更老一代的奔腾机器、奔腾处理器和
--they realized the thing is so simple and 00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:15,400
他们意识到事情是如此简单
--small that they could stamp out a lot of them on one chip. 00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:19,600
小到他们可以在一个芯片上消除很多。
--So there's something called the PHY, which you'll be using, and 00:47:19,600 --> 00:47:22,520
所以有一种叫做 PHY 的东西，你会用到它，并且
--it has 60-some Intel cores on it. 00:47:22,520 --> 00:47:27,000
它有 60 多个英特尔内核。
--And then we'll also talk about GPUs in this course. 00:47:30,320 --> 00:47:32,960
然后我们还将在本课程中讨论 GPU。
--So GPUs have a very specific model for 00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:38,680
所以 GPU 有一个非常具体的模型
--doing execution that was designed for graphics processing originally. 00:47:38,680 --> 00:47:43,600
执行原本为图形处理而设计的执行。
--And it works very well for certain things. 00:47:43,600 --> 00:47:45,800
它对某些事情非常有效。
--So if it maps well to your problem, 00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:48,240
所以如果它很好地映射到你的问题，
--it may be a very good way to get good performance. 00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:51,160
这可能是获得良好性能的好方法。
--And they have lots and lots of compute elements. 00:47:51,160 --> 00:47:53,800
他们有很多很多计算元素。
--So each little tiny square that you see here is a processor. 00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:59,080
所以你在这里看到的每个小方块都是一个处理器。
--So these things typically have thousands of compute elements on them. 00:47:59,080 --> 00:48:02,280
所以这些东西通常有数千个计算元素。
--Okay, and then things like phones and 00:48:05,600 --> 00:48:07,920
好的，然后是手机之类的东西
--tablets also have multiple processors on them. 00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:11,520
平板电脑上也有多个处理器。
--In those devices, we're talking usually like two to six processors, not thousands. 00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:16,560
在这些设备中，我们通常谈论的是两到六个处理器，而不是数千个。
--But they have GPUs on them also. 00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:18,360
但他们也有 GPU。
--So that's another source of parallelism. 00:48:19,360 --> 00:48:21,440
所以这是并行性的另一个来源。
--And then finally, for fun, if we look at the really high end, 00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:24,640
最后，为了好玩，如果我们看看真正的高端，
--this is one of the fastest supercomputers in the United States today at Oak Ridge. 00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:30,280
这是当今美国在橡树岭的最快的超级计算机之一。
--And it has 18,000 16-core processors and 18,000 GPUs. 00:48:30,280 --> 00:48:38,720
它拥有 18,000 个 16 核处理器和 18,000 个 GPU。
--So it has hundreds of thousands of processors in it. 00:48:38,720 --> 00:48:42,400
所以它里面有几十万个处理器。
--So the upshot is in the world today, 00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:46,560
所以结果是在今天的世界上，
--we have lots and lots of parallel machines. 00:48:46,560 --> 00:48:48,760
我们有很多很多并行机器。
--So how do we make use of them? 00:48:48,760 --> 00:48:50,360
那么我们如何利用它们呢？
--How can we take advantage of them? 00:48:50,360 --> 00:48:51,720
我们如何利用它们？
--Okay, so in this class, 00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:56,200
好的，所以在这节课中，
--we're gonna be talking about parallelism and parallel computing. 00:48:56,200 --> 00:48:59,840
我们将讨论并行性和并行计算。
--Now, so what, so okay, the class is about to become a lot more interactive. 00:48:59,840 --> 00:49:04,240
现在，那又怎么样，好吧，课堂将变得更加互动。
--I'm gonna start asking you questions, and 00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:06,400
我要开始问你问题，然后
--we're gonna have some interactive demos in just a second here. 00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:09,720
稍后我们将进行一些互动演示。
--So this class is about parallel computing. 00:49:09,720 --> 00:49:12,600
所以这门课是关于并行计算的。
--So what is a parallel computer, as opposed to a non-parallel computer? 00:49:12,600 --> 00:49:16,680
那么什么是并行计算机，而不是非并行计算机呢？
--So what makes a parallel computer different? 00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:21,040
那么是什么让并行计算机与众不同呢？
--Yep. 00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:23,940
是的。
--Yeah, so it has multiple computers in it. 00:49:25,800 --> 00:49:29,400
是的，所以它里面有多台电脑。
--Now, right now, each of you has at least a phone, and 00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:33,320
现在，现在，你们每个人至少有一部手机，而且
--I see a bunch of laptops and things. 00:49:33,320 --> 00:49:34,960
我看到一堆笔记本电脑之类的东西。
--So in this room, we've got lots and lots of different phones and laptops. 00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:39,440
所以在这个房间里，我们有很多很多不同的手机和笔记本电脑。
--So are all the computers in this room, are they a parallel computer? 00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:43,320
那么这个房间里所有的电脑，都是并行电脑吗？
--Well, I mean collectively. 00:49:47,320 --> 00:49:48,960
好吧，我的意思是集体。
--Do we have like one giant parallel computer here? 00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:53,480
我们这里有一台巨型并行计算机吗？
--So, well, not necessarily, maybe. 00:49:53,480 --> 00:49:58,280
所以，嗯，不一定，也许。
--So it's more than just having a bunch of processors. 00:49:58,280 --> 00:50:01,240
所以它不仅仅是拥有一堆处理器。
--So here's one textbook-y type definition of what a parallel computer is. 00:50:01,240 --> 00:50:07,200
所以这是关于什么是并行计算机的教科书式定义。
--So it does have, we have multiple processing elements. 00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:11,960
所以它确实有，我们有多个处理元素。
--That's the obvious thing. 00:50:11,960 --> 00:50:13,760
这是显而易见的事情。
--But the part that makes it interesting and challenging is 00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:17,240
但让它变得有趣和具有挑战性的部分是
--that they actually need to not just exist, they need to cooperate. 00:50:17,240 --> 00:50:22,000
他们实际上不仅需要存在，还需要合作。
--They need to work together to solve some single problem faster. 00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:28,680
他们需要一起工作来更快地解决一些单一的问题。
--So parallelism is about making things run faster using, 00:50:28,680 --> 00:50:33,560
所以并行性是关于让事情运行得更快使用，
--harnessing the power of lots of processors. 00:50:33,560 --> 00:50:36,880
利用大量处理器的力量。
--And that's not an easy thing to do, but that's the point of this course. 00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:40,080
这不是一件容易的事，但这就是本课程的重点。
--Okay, so now what we're ready to do is do some parallel programming. 00:50:41,880 --> 00:50:47,280
好的，现在我们准备做的是进行一些并行编程。
--But, so the next four or 00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:50,000
但是，所以接下来的四个或
--five lectures are all going to be about how issues related to parallel software. 00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:55,280
五讲都是关于如何与并行软件相关的问题。
--But before we do that, what I'm going to do today is we're going to have 00:50:55,280 --> 00:50:58,840
但在我们这样做之前，我今天要做的是我们将拥有
--a couple of, we're going to do a little bit of human computation. 00:50:58,840 --> 00:51:02,400
一些，我们将进行一些人工计算。
--So for most of the remaining time, 00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:06,080
所以在剩下的大部分时间里，
--we're going to be doing demos with volunteers from the audience. 00:51:06,080 --> 00:51:10,200
我们将与观众中的志愿者进行演示。
--And believe it or not, we're going to actually learn a lot from 00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:12,600
信不信由你，我们实际上会从中学到很多东西
--doing these demos about how parallel software works. 00:51:12,600 --> 00:51:16,560
做这些关于并行软件如何工作的演示。
--Okay, so I need a volunteer for the first demo. 00:51:16,560 --> 00:51:20,600
好的，所以我需要一名志愿者来进行第一个演示。
--And the only skill that's required is that you can add single digit numbers. 00:51:20,600 --> 00:51:25,200
唯一需要的技能是您可以添加个位数。
--So, I need a volunteer. 00:51:26,760 --> 00:51:29,560
所以，我需要一个志愿者。
--Can someone come down here? 00:51:29,560 --> 00:51:30,400
有人可以下来吗？
--I'm going to be asking for lots of volunteers. 00:51:31,400 --> 00:51:33,320
我会要求很多志愿者。
--So, you might want to get the volunteering out of the way early. 00:51:33,320 --> 00:51:36,840
因此，您可能希望尽早摆脱志愿服务。
--Great, thank you. 00:51:36,840 --> 00:51:37,560
太好了谢谢。
--So, hey. 00:51:39,800 --> 00:51:41,120
所以，嘿。
--And what's your name? 00:51:41,120 --> 00:51:41,800
那么，你叫什么？
--Hi, Sam. 00:51:41,800 --> 00:51:42,480
你好山姆。
--Hey, Sam. 00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:43,280
嘿，山姆。
--So, what I have here is, so hang on a second. 00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:47,720
所以，我这里有，等一下。
--So what I'm going to do is, I'm going to time this. 00:51:47,720 --> 00:51:52,120
所以我要做的是，我要计时。
--So, but don't worry, there's no right or wrong. 00:51:52,120 --> 00:51:57,840
所以，但别担心，没有对错之分。
--Well, there's a right answer for that. 00:51:57,840 --> 00:51:59,440
好吧，有一个正确的答案。
--But what I'm going to do is, I want to see how long it takes. 00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:03,600
但我要做的是，我想看看需要多长时间。
--And what we're going to do is, we're going to, this will be our starting point. 00:52:03,600 --> 00:52:07,920
我们要做的是，我们要做，这将是我们的起点。
--We're going to have Sam add up 16 numbers. 00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:12,600
我们要让山姆把 16 个数字相加。
--And we're just going to count how long that takes. 00:52:12,600 --> 00:52:14,800
我们只是要计算这需要多长时间。
--And then we're going to start doing that in parallel. 00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:17,240
然后我们将开始并行进行。
--So this is just to get a baseline number. 00:52:17,240 --> 00:52:20,240
所以这只是为了获得一个基线数字。
--So when you're ready, you can go ahead and add those up. 00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:24,000
所以当你准备好了，你可以继续把它们加起来。
--And the sixes and nines have lines underneath them, so. 00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:27,160
 6 号和 9 号下面有线，所以。
--Go ahead. 00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:28,260
前进。
--Do it in your head, sorry. 00:52:31,400 --> 00:52:33,080
做你的头脑，对不起。
--Sorry, didn't realize. 00:52:33,080 --> 00:52:34,720
对不起，没有意识到。
--Yep. 00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:35,220
是的。
--Yeah? 00:52:58,100 --> 00:53:00,300
是的？
--Yes? 00:53:00,300 --> 00:53:02,300
是的？
--Go ahead. 00:53:02,300 --> 00:53:05,280
前进。
--No? 00:53:08,280 --> 00:53:09,040
不？
--No. 00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:22,180
不。
--But don't worry. 00:53:22,180 --> 00:53:25,180
不过别担心。
--Yeah? 00:53:25,180 --> 00:53:30,180
是的？
--Yeah, that's right. 00:53:30,180 --> 00:53:32,180
是啊，没错。
--Okay, great. 00:53:32,180 --> 00:53:34,180
好的，太好了。
--Okay, thank you. 00:53:34,180 --> 00:53:36,180
好的谢谢。
--Okay, so that took 56 seconds. 00:53:36,180 --> 00:53:43,180
好的，所以这花了 56 秒。
--Okay, so that's our sequential version of this computation. 00:53:43,180 --> 00:53:48,180
好的，这就是我们这个计算的顺序版本。
--So our computation for today is adding up 16 numbers. 00:53:48,180 --> 00:53:53,180
所以我们今天的计算是将 16 个数字相加。
--Okay, so now let's start to do this in parallel. 00:53:53,180 --> 00:53:55,180
好的，现在让我们开始并行执行此操作。
--So first we're going to use, I'm going to get a different set of numbers here. 00:53:55,180 --> 00:53:59,180
所以首先我们要使用，我要在这里得到一组不同的数字。
--These will all be single digit numbers, sets of single digit numbers. 00:53:59,180 --> 00:54:04,180
这些都是个位数，个位数的集合。
--Okay, so this time we're going to do it with two processors. 00:54:04,180 --> 00:54:10,180
好的，这次我们将使用两个处理器来完成。
--And I want to volunteer from somewhere kind of back here. 00:54:10,180 --> 00:54:14,180
我想从这里的某个地方做志愿者。
--I need one volunteer to come to the front of the room, first of all. 00:54:14,180 --> 00:54:17,180
首先，我需要一名志愿者来到会议室前面。
--Can somebody come on up? 00:54:17,180 --> 00:54:19,180
有人可以上来吗？
--Okay, great. 00:54:19,180 --> 00:54:21,180
好的，太好了。
--Hey, how are you? 00:54:22,180 --> 00:54:23,180
嘿，你怎么样？
--And what's your name? 00:54:23,180 --> 00:54:24,180
那么，你叫什么？
--Oh, nice. 00:54:24,180 --> 00:54:25,180
不错哦。
--Nice to meet you. 00:54:25,180 --> 00:54:26,180
很高兴见到你。
--Okay, so I've got, so wait a second. 00:54:26,180 --> 00:54:28,180
好的，我知道了，请稍等。
--I've got a set of numbers for you to add up. 00:54:28,180 --> 00:54:30,180
我有一组数字供你加起来。
--And I need another volunteer, somebody from further up in the room. 00:54:30,180 --> 00:54:38,180
我需要另一位志愿者，来自房间更远一点的人。
--Okay, great. 00:54:38,180 --> 00:54:39,180
好的，太好了。
--So, hey, how are you? 00:54:39,180 --> 00:54:42,180
所以，嘿，你好吗？
--What's your name? 00:54:42,180 --> 00:54:43,180
你叫什么名字？
--Frank. 00:54:43,180 --> 00:54:44,180
坦率。
--Hey, Frank. 00:54:44,180 --> 00:54:45,180
嘿，弗兰克。
--So, Frank, so I want you to stand here. 00:54:45,180 --> 00:54:47,180
所以，弗兰克，所以我要你站在这里。
--And in a second when I tell you to start, you're going to start adding them up. 00:54:47,180 --> 00:54:50,180
当我告诉你开始的时候，你马上就会开始把它们加起来。
--And I want you to add them all up here. 00:54:50,180 --> 00:54:52,180
我希望你把它们都加在这里。
--And when you're done, you can come up. 00:54:52,180 --> 00:54:54,180
当你完成后，你可以上来。
--Now, the goal is we want to know that each of you have half of the numbers. 00:54:54,180 --> 00:54:58,180
现在，目标是我们想知道你们每个人都有一半的数字。
--I gave you both eight single digit numbers. 00:54:58,180 --> 00:55:01,180
我给了你们两个八个单位数字。
--And the one thing is we want the total sum of the numbers. 00:55:01,180 --> 00:55:05,180
一件事是我们想要数字的总和。
--But the only way you're allowed to communicate with each other is by writing on this piece of paper. 00:55:05,180 --> 00:55:10,180
但是你们唯一可以相互交流的方式就是在这张纸上写字。
--So you can't talk to each other. 00:55:10,180 --> 00:55:12,180
所以你们不能互相交谈。
--So when you're done, you can come up and write. 00:55:12,180 --> 00:55:14,180
所以当你完成后，你可以上来写。
--And you can write. 00:55:14,180 --> 00:55:15,180
你可以写。
--And we'll get a grand total. 00:55:15,180 --> 00:55:17,180
我们会得到一个总计。
--So, okay. 00:55:17,180 --> 00:55:20,180
所以，好吧。
--So are you ready to start? 00:55:20,180 --> 00:55:21,180
那么你准备好开始了吗？
--Okay. 00:55:21,180 --> 00:55:22,180
好的。
--All right, go. 00:55:22,180 --> 00:55:23,180
好吧，走吧。
--Yep, that's right. 00:55:47,180 --> 00:56:01,180
是的，没错。
--Yep. 00:56:01,180 --> 00:56:02,180
是的。
--All right. 00:56:02,180 --> 00:56:03,180
好的。
--Thank you. 00:56:03,180 --> 00:56:04,180
谢谢。
--All right. 00:56:04,180 --> 00:56:05,180
好的。
--So and you guys can have a seat. 00:56:05,180 --> 00:56:08,180
所以，你们可以坐下了。
--Thank you. 00:56:08,180 --> 00:56:09,180
谢谢。
--So that took 34 seconds. 00:56:09,180 --> 00:56:14,180
所以这花了 34 秒。
--So, okay. 00:56:14,180 --> 00:56:16,180
所以，好吧。
--So 34 is faster than 56. 00:56:16,180 --> 00:56:19,180
所以 34 比 56 快。
--So things got faster. 00:56:19,180 --> 00:56:21,180
所以事情变得更快了。
--Now, ideally, how much faster would you like to see this computation take if you had twice as many computers working on it? 00:56:21,180 --> 00:56:31,180
现在，理想情况下，如果你有两倍的计算机在计算，你希望看到这个计算速度多快？
--Maybe it would be twice as fast, right? 00:56:31,180 --> 00:56:34,180
也许它会快两倍，对吧？
--So was it twice as fast? 00:56:34,180 --> 00:56:36,180
那么它的速度是原来的两倍吗？
--Not quite. 00:56:36,180 --> 00:56:38,180
不完全的。
--It's a little bit slower than twice as fast. 00:56:38,180 --> 00:56:40,180
它比两倍的速度慢一点。
--And that's fairly typical for what we might see when we do parallel software. 00:56:41,180 --> 00:56:46,180
这对于我们在开发并行软件时可能会看到的情况来说是相当典型的。
--And one thing that i want to point out is the number that we're going to use. 00:56:46,180 --> 00:56:51,180
我想指出的一件事是我们将要使用的数字。
--When we talk about things getting faster, it's very confusing to say something like that got 50% faster. 00:56:51,180 --> 00:56:59,180
当我们谈论事情变快时，说速度提高了 50% 是非常令人困惑的。
--Like what does 50% faster mean? 00:56:59,180 --> 00:57:02,180
比如快 50% 是什么意思？
--Or like what does 100% faster mean? 00:57:02,180 --> 00:57:04,180
或者像 100% 更快意味着什么？
--Does that mean it disappeared entirely? 00:57:04,180 --> 00:57:06,180
这是否意味着它完全消失了？
--Or does that mean it's two times faster? 00:57:06,180 --> 00:57:08,180
或者这是否意味着它快两倍？
--So when we talk about performance, we're always going to use this term, this ratio that we'll call speed up. 00:57:08,180 --> 00:57:16,180
所以当我们谈论性能时，我们总是会使用这个术语，这个我们称之为加速的比率。
--And the way we calculate speed up is it's the ratio of the time that it took on one processor. 00:57:16,180 --> 00:57:24,180
我们计算加速的方式是它在一个处理器上花费的时间的比率。
--So in our example, that would be 56 divided by the amount of time it takes on multiple processors. 00:57:24,180 --> 00:57:32,180
所以在我们的例子中，这将是 56 除以它在多个处理器上花费的时间。
--In this case, it was two. 00:57:32,180 --> 00:57:34,180
在这种情况下，它是两个。
--So we've got two. 00:57:34,180 --> 00:57:36,180
所以我们有两个。
--And that number is 34. 00:57:36,180 --> 00:57:38,180
这个数字是 34。
--So this number is, if anybody has a calculator, you can figure that out. 00:57:38,180 --> 00:57:42,180
所以这个数字是，如果有人有计算器，你可以算出来。
--But it's a little bit less than two. 00:57:42,180 --> 00:57:44,180
但是还不到两个。
--So, okay. 00:57:44,180 --> 00:57:46,180
所以，好吧。
--So our speed up is one point whatever it is, eight-ish or something like that, I think. 00:57:46,180 --> 00:57:52,180
所以我们的加速是一点，不管它是什么，8 左右或类似的东西，我想。
--So what did we notice here? 00:57:52,180 --> 00:57:55,180
那么我们在这里注意到了什么？
--So, okay. 00:57:55,180 --> 00:57:57,180
所以，好吧。
--What were some of the sources of, let me back up. 00:57:57,180 --> 00:58:01,180
有哪些来源，让我备份一下。
--Let's let you think this through. 00:58:01,180 --> 00:58:03,180
让我们让你考虑清楚。
--I'm not just going to give you the answer. 00:58:03,180 --> 00:58:05,180
我不只是要给你答案。
--So what were some of the reasons why it was not quite twice as fast? 00:58:05,180 --> 00:58:10,180
那么它没有快两倍的一些原因是什么？
--Did you see any inefficiencies when you watched this demo? 00:58:10,180 --> 00:58:14,180
观看此演示时，您是否发现任何低效之处？
--Yep. 00:58:14,180 --> 00:58:15,180
是的。
--Well, like the time to run down the stairs and actually combine the two pieces of information. 00:58:15,180 --> 00:58:20,180
好吧，就像跑下楼梯并实际结合两条信息的时间一样。
--Yep. 00:58:20,180 --> 00:58:21,180
是的。
--Exactly. 00:58:21,180 --> 00:58:22,180
确切地。
--So the reason why I had Frank start up there and walk down here is to make that more realistic in terms of what happens with actual processors. 00:58:22,180 --> 00:58:31,180
所以我让 Frank 从那里开始然后走到这里的原因是为了使实际处理器的情况更加真实。
--Because they are not, even though they're on the same chip, when they want to communicate with each other, they have to transmit information through wires. 00:58:31,180 --> 00:58:39,180
因为它们不是，即使它们在同一个芯片上，当它们想要相互通信时，它们也必须通过电线传输信息。
--And that actually takes time. 00:58:39,180 --> 00:58:41,180
而这实际上需要时间。
--So it's a bit like having to run up here. 00:58:41,180 --> 00:58:43,180
所以这有点像必须跑到这里。
--And another thing that you may have noticed is even when Frank got up here, they weren't finished yet. 00:58:43,180 --> 00:58:49,180
你可能已经注意到的另一件事是，即使弗兰克站到这里，他们还没有完成。
--He had to actually see what was on the paper and add up those numbers and get the results. 00:58:49,180 --> 00:58:57,180
他必须实际查看纸上的内容，然后将这些数字相加并得出结果。
--So those are some reasons why we had a little bit of inefficiency. 00:58:58,180 --> 00:59:04,180
所以这些就是我们效率低下的一些原因。
--Okay. 00:59:04,180 --> 00:59:05,180
好的。
--So that was fun. 00:59:05,180 --> 00:59:06,180
所以这很有趣。
--But now we're going to go two processors is nice, but four is even better. 00:59:06,180 --> 00:59:10,180
但现在我们要使用两个处理器很好，但四个更好。
--So now I need four volunteers because we're going to scale this up some more. 00:59:10,180 --> 00:59:15,180
所以现在我需要四名志愿者，因为我们要扩大规模。
--So four people can please come down here. 00:59:15,180 --> 00:59:18,180
请四个人下来。
--That would be great. 00:59:18,180 --> 00:59:23,180
那太好了。
--Okay, that's one. 00:59:23,180 --> 00:59:27,180
好的，就是一个。
--Okay. 00:59:27,180 --> 00:59:28,180
好的。
--The good news is you have to add up even fewer numbers when you do this. 00:59:28,180 --> 00:59:31,180
好消息是，当您这样做时，您需要加起来的数字会更少。
--So come on down. 00:59:31,180 --> 00:59:32,180
所以，下来吧。
--I know. 00:59:32,180 --> 00:59:33,180
我知道。
--I know you were admitted to CMU. 00:59:33,180 --> 00:59:35,180
我知道你被 CMU 录取了。
--I'm sure you can handle the computational task here. 00:59:35,180 --> 00:59:38,180
我相信您可以在这里处理计算任务。
--So great. 00:59:38,180 --> 00:59:40,180
很好。
--Okay. 00:59:40,180 --> 00:59:41,180
好的。
--That's two. 00:59:41,180 --> 00:59:42,180
那是两个。
--All right. 00:59:42,180 --> 00:59:43,180
好的。
--Somebody from over here. 00:59:43,180 --> 00:59:47,180
这里有人。
--Maybe Greg can help me draft people. 00:59:47,180 --> 00:59:51,180
也许 Greg 可以帮我选人。
--All right. 00:59:51,180 --> 00:59:54,180
好的。
--Okay, great. 00:59:54,180 --> 00:59:55,180
好的，太好了。
--All right. 00:59:55,180 --> 00:59:56,180
好的。
--There's a stairway here. 00:59:56,180 --> 00:59:57,180
这里有一个楼梯。
--Thank you. 00:59:57,180 --> 00:59:58,180
谢谢。
--Great. 00:59:58,180 --> 00:59:59,180
伟大的。
--Thanks. 00:59:59,180 --> 01:00:03,180
谢谢。
--So the good news is I'm not going to make any of you go stand up there. 01:00:03,180 --> 01:00:06,180
所以好消息是我不会让你们任何人站在那里。
--You can all gather around the table here. 01:00:06,180 --> 01:00:09,180
你们都可以在这里围坐在桌子旁。
--And what I'm going to do in a second is I'm going to give you your I'm going to take the 16 numbers. 01:00:09,180 --> 01:00:14,180
我马上要做的是我要给你你的我要拿 16 个数字。
--I'm going to divide them up into piles. 01:00:14,180 --> 01:00:16,180
我要把它们分成几堆。
--I'm going to give if you spread around a little bit, you each are going to get a pile in a minute. 01:00:16,180 --> 01:00:20,180
我要给，如果你散开一点，你们每个人都会在一分钟内得到一堆。
--So it's the same type of deal where you can't talk to each other. 01:00:20,180 --> 01:00:25,180
所以这是同一种交易，你们不能互相交谈。
--You're going to add up the numbers. 01:00:25,180 --> 01:00:27,180
你要把这些数字加起来。
--And using that pen and paper, you're going to get the grand total. 01:00:27,180 --> 01:00:31,180
使用笔和纸，您将得到总计。
--So let me hand out my piles of numbers here. 01:00:31,180 --> 01:00:39,180
所以让我在这里分发我的一堆数字。
--Okay. 01:00:39,180 --> 01:00:40,180
好的。
--Don't start yet until I have a chance to. 01:00:40,180 --> 01:00:44,180
在我有机会之前不要开始。
--Okay. 01:00:44,180 --> 01:00:45,180
好的。
--I'll time this. 01:00:45,180 --> 01:00:53,180
我会计时的。
--Okay. 01:00:53,180 --> 01:00:54,180
好的。
--You ready? 01:00:54,180 --> 01:00:55,180
你准备好了吗？
--On your mark, get set, go. 01:00:55,180 --> 01:00:56,180
各就各位，准备就绪，出发。
--All right. 01:01:15,180 --> 01:01:36,180
好的。
--Well, let's just pretend you were just finished there. 01:01:36,180 --> 01:01:39,180
好吧，让我们假装你刚刚完成那里。
--Okay. 01:01:39,180 --> 01:01:40,180
好的。
--All right. 01:01:40,180 --> 01:01:41,180
好的。
--Well, imagine that you just finished that up. 01:01:41,180 --> 01:01:44,180
好吧，想象一下你刚刚完成了它。
--Okay. 01:01:44,180 --> 01:01:45,180
好的。
--Thank you. 01:01:45,180 --> 01:01:46,180
谢谢。
--Don't leave yet. 01:01:46,180 --> 01:01:47,180
还不离开。
--We're going to well, let's have a round of applause for our brave volunteers here. 01:01:47,180 --> 01:01:50,180
我们走好，让我们为这里勇敢的志愿者鼓掌。
--So okay. 01:01:50,180 --> 01:01:51,180
好吧。
--So now with four processors, that took 39 seconds. 01:01:51,180 --> 01:01:59,180
所以现在有四个处理器，需要 39 秒。
--Okay. 01:01:59,180 --> 01:02:00,180
好的。
--Hmm. 01:02:00,180 --> 01:02:01,180
唔。
--Well, that's not four times faster than that, is it? 01:02:01,180 --> 01:02:04,180
好吧，这不会比那快四倍，是吗？
--So I okay. 01:02:04,180 --> 01:02:07,180
所以我没事。
--So what happened? 01:02:07,180 --> 01:02:08,180
所以发生了什么事？
--What did you observe happening up here? 01:02:08,180 --> 01:02:11,180
你观察到这里发生了什么？
--Why did it take a while? 01:02:11,180 --> 01:02:12,180
为什么需要一段时间？
--Yep. 01:02:12,180 --> 01:02:13,180
是的。
--Yes. 01:02:13,180 --> 01:02:14,180
是的。
--There was a bottleneck. 01:02:14,180 --> 01:02:15,180
有一个瓶颈。
--So specifically like what evil thing did I do to our friend in the black shirt here? 01:02:15,180 --> 01:02:21,180
所以具体来说，比如我对我们穿黑衬衫的朋友做了什么坏事？
--It was dysfunctional. 01:02:21,180 --> 01:02:25,180
这是功能失调的。
--Yeah. 01:02:25,180 --> 01:02:26,180
是的。
--Do you notice anything? 01:02:26,180 --> 01:02:27,180
你注意到什么了吗？
--Yep. 01:02:27,180 --> 01:02:28,180
是的。
--You gave him many more numbers than anyone else. 01:02:28,180 --> 01:02:29,180
你给他的数字比任何人都多。
--Yeah. 01:02:29,180 --> 01:02:30,180
是的。
--So I actually, there's a total of 16 numbers, but he ended up having more than four. 01:02:30,180 --> 01:02:36,180
所以我实际上总共有 16 个数字，但他最终有四个以上。
--Way more than four actually. 01:02:36,180 --> 01:02:38,180
实际上不止四个。
--So that's okay. 01:02:38,180 --> 01:02:41,180
所以没关系。
--So why did I do that? 01:02:41,180 --> 01:02:42,180
那我为什么要那样做？
--Because actually that happens a lot in parallel software, which is you have work to do, and 01:02:42,180 --> 01:02:47,180
因为实际上这在并行软件中经常发生，这是你有工作要做的，而且
--it's not always easy to divide it up ahead of time evenly. 01:02:47,180 --> 01:02:51,180
提前平均分配它并不总是那么容易。
--So one thing that can go wrong is that if the work is not balanced very well, some processors 01:02:51,180 --> 01:02:57,180
所以可能出错的一件事是，如果工作没有很好地平衡，一些处理器
--can be finished. 01:02:57,180 --> 01:02:59,180
可以完成。
--So you saw like the three people on the left were basically done, and then they're waiting 01:02:59,180 --> 01:03:03,180
所以你看到左边的三个人基本上已经完成了，然后他们在等待
--around. 01:03:03,180 --> 01:03:04,180
大约。
--And while they're waiting around, they don't have anything useful to do. 01:03:04,180 --> 01:03:06,180
当他们在附近等待时，他们没有任何有用的事情可做。
--You have to just wait until the last one finishes before you can get to it. 01:03:06,180 --> 01:03:10,180
您必须等到最后一个完成后才能开始。
--And that was the major reason why it took that long. 01:03:10,180 --> 01:03:14,180
这就是花了那么长时间的主要原因。
--Did you notice anything else? 01:03:14,180 --> 01:03:15,180
你还注意到其他什么吗？
--Any other source of inefficiency beyond that? 01:03:15,180 --> 01:03:19,180
除此之外还有其他效率低下的原因吗？
--Writing stuff. 01:03:19,180 --> 01:03:22,180
写东西。
--Yeah. 01:03:22,180 --> 01:03:23,180
是的。
--So it's not only did like, before we had two people had to write something, but now all 01:03:23,180 --> 01:03:29,180
所以它不仅像之前我们有两个人必须写东西，但现在所有人
--of you had to write things. 01:03:29,180 --> 01:03:30,180
你们中的一些人不得不写东西。
--So you had to go grab the pen and then add up all those numbers. 01:03:30,180 --> 01:03:35,180
所以你必须去拿笔然后把所有这些数字加起来。
--So that's another type of bottleneck. 01:03:35,180 --> 01:03:37,180
所以这是另一种类型的瓶颈。
--OK. 01:03:38,180 --> 01:03:39,180
好的。
--So if you can stay up here, we're going to do this again, but we're going to do it with 01:03:39,180 --> 01:03:44,180
所以如果你能待在这里，我们将再次这样做，但我们将与
--a different ground rule here, which is that this time I'm also going to give you piles 01:03:44,180 --> 01:03:50,180
这里有一个不同的基本规则，那就是这次我也会给你一堆
--of numbers divided up, perhaps evilly again. 01:03:50,180 --> 01:03:55,180
数字分裂，也许又是邪恶的。
--But I'm going to let you work out a better way to do this. 01:03:55,180 --> 01:03:59,180
但我会让你想出更好的方法来做到这一点。
--So maybe in particular, you're not restricted to only adding up the numbers I give you initially. 01:03:59,180 --> 01:04:06,180
所以也许特别是，您不仅限于将我最初给您的数字相加。
--So maybe the four of you can talk amongst yourselves for a second and think of a strategy 01:04:06,180 --> 01:04:11,180
所以也许你们四个人可以互相交谈一下并想出一个策略
--for trying to do it a little faster this time. 01:04:11,180 --> 01:04:14,180
这次尝试做得更快一点。
--So you can't talk, but you can move numbers around if you want to. 01:04:14,180 --> 01:04:23,180
所以你不能说话，但如果你愿意，你可以四处移动数字。
--We can talk right now. 01:04:23,180 --> 01:04:24,180
我们现在可以谈谈。
--You can talk now. 01:04:24,180 --> 01:04:25,180
你现在可以说话了。
--You can talk now. 01:04:25,180 --> 01:04:26,180
你现在可以说话了。
--So think now. 01:04:26,180 --> 01:04:27,180
所以现在想想。
--Figure out what you might do so that it goes faster. 01:04:27,180 --> 01:04:32,180
弄清楚你可以做什么，这样它会更快。
--How many tries do we get at this? 01:05:03,180 --> 01:05:19,180
我们对此进行了多少次尝试？
--Well, we're going to do it this one time, and that'll be it. 01:05:19,180 --> 01:05:22,180
好吧，我们只做一次，仅此而已。
--But maybe you can coordinate a little bit at the start of this process. 01:05:22,180 --> 01:05:26,180
但也许您可以在此流程开始时进行一些协调。
--So when I say go, you're allowed to actually move stuff. 01:05:26,180 --> 01:05:31,180
所以当我说走的时候，你可以实际移动东西。
--But you just can't talk. 01:05:31,180 --> 01:05:32,180
但你就是不能说话。
--There are only 16 numbers. 01:05:32,180 --> 01:05:40,180
只有16个数字。
--So are you ready? 01:05:40,180 --> 01:05:41,180
那么你准备好了吗？
--I'm going to hand these out. 01:05:41,180 --> 01:05:42,180
我要把这些分发出去。
--So don't start yet, but I'll put piles in front of you. 01:05:42,180 --> 01:05:49,180
所以先不要开始，但我会在你面前放一堆东西。
--So on your mark, get set, go. 01:05:50,180 --> 01:06:15,180
所以在你的标记上，开始吧。
--Okay. 01:06:15,180 --> 01:06:16,180
好的。
--Great. 01:06:16,180 --> 01:06:17,180
伟大的。
--What was the answer? 01:06:18,180 --> 01:06:19,180
答案是什么？
--88. 01:06:19,180 --> 01:06:20,180
 88.
--Okay. 01:06:20,180 --> 01:06:21,180
好的。
--Yep. 01:06:21,180 --> 01:06:22,180
是的。
--All right. 01:06:22,180 --> 01:06:23,180
好的。
--So that took 24 seconds. 01:06:23,180 --> 01:06:25,180
所以这花了 24 秒。
--So that was actually a lot faster. 01:06:25,180 --> 01:06:28,180
所以这实际上要快得多。
--So what was your strategy this time? 01:06:28,180 --> 01:06:31,180
那么这次你的策略是什么？
--So we got to see a bit of this. 01:06:31,180 --> 01:06:33,180
所以我们必须看到一点。
--For the people in the back of the room, we may not have seen it. 01:06:33,180 --> 01:06:35,180
对于房间后面的人，我们可能没有看到它。
--So what do you do differently now? 01:06:35,180 --> 01:06:38,180
那你现在有什么不同的做法吗？
--We split it up into four numbers each. 01:06:38,180 --> 01:06:40,180
我们把它分成四个数字。
--Yep. 01:06:40,180 --> 01:06:41,180
是的。
--And only one person totaled at the end. 01:06:41,180 --> 01:06:44,180
最后总共只有一个人。
--Yep. 01:06:44,180 --> 01:06:45,180
是的。
--Yep. 01:06:45,180 --> 01:06:46,180
是的。
--So that made it a lot faster. 01:06:46,180 --> 01:06:47,180
所以这让它快了很多。
--So thank you for volunteering. 01:06:47,180 --> 01:06:49,180
所以谢谢你的志愿服务。
--You can go back and have a seat. 01:06:49,180 --> 01:06:51,180
你可以回去坐下。
--So what we saw in those two demos there was that the load imbalance is one of the major challenges. 01:06:51,180 --> 01:07:02,180
所以我们在这两个演示中看到的是，负载不平衡是主要挑战之一。
--There are many challenges. 01:07:02,180 --> 01:07:03,180
有很多挑战。
--But one of the things that can really cause performance to suffer is if you don't have even amounts of work. 01:07:03,180 --> 01:07:10,180
但是，真正会导致性能下降的其中一件事是，如果您的工作量不足。
--So in the second try, they basically rebalanced the work so that they each were adding up four numbers. 01:07:11,180 --> 01:07:17,180
所以在第二次尝试中，他们基本上重新平衡了工作，以便他们每个人都将四个数字相加。
--And then that helped a lot. 01:07:17,180 --> 01:07:18,180
然后这很有帮助。
--Now, one thing is it did take a little time to do that rebalancing. 01:07:18,180 --> 01:07:22,180
现在，一件事是重新平衡确实需要一点时间。
--So that was a source of additional overhead. 01:07:22,180 --> 01:07:25,180
所以这是额外开销的来源。
--But in this case, it paid off quite a bit. 01:07:25,180 --> 01:07:28,180
但在这种情况下，它得到了很多回报。
--It was significantly faster. 01:07:28,180 --> 01:07:32,180
它明显更快。
--Okay. 01:07:32,180 --> 01:07:33,180
好的。
--Now all of you are volunteering. 01:07:33,180 --> 01:07:36,180
现在你们都是自愿的。
--We're going to do a massively parallel computation right now. 01:07:36,180 --> 01:07:39,180
我们现在要进行大规模并行计算。
--And what I want to know is I want to know the grand total of the number of courses that each of you is registered for in the room right now. 01:07:39,180 --> 01:07:47,180
我想知道的是，我想知道你们每个人现在在房间里注册的课程总数。
--Hopefully those are single-digit numbers. 01:07:47,180 --> 01:07:49,180
希望这些是个位数。
--Okay. 01:07:49,180 --> 01:07:50,180
好的。
--So there are about 150-ish of you in the room. 01:07:50,180 --> 01:07:54,180
所以房间里大约有 150 人左右。
--So we have to add up about 150 numbers. 01:07:54,180 --> 01:07:56,180
所以我们必须加起来大约 150 个数字。
--Now, there are some ground rules for this. 01:07:56,180 --> 01:07:58,180
现在，有一些基本规则。
--You can only talk to your neighbors either to your left or right or in front or behind you. 01:07:58,180 --> 01:08:04,180
你只能和你左边或右边或前面或后面的邻居说话。
--No just sort of shouting out across the room. 01:08:04,180 --> 01:08:07,180
不只是在房间里大喊大叫。
--It probably wouldn't work so well anyway. 01:08:07,180 --> 01:08:09,180
无论如何，它可能不会很好地工作。
--So you ready? 01:08:09,180 --> 01:08:10,180
所以你准备好了吗？
--Oh, no, you're not ready. 01:08:10,180 --> 01:08:12,180
哦，不，你还没准备好。
--So how are we going to do this? 01:08:12,180 --> 01:08:15,180
那么我们要怎么做呢？
--Any thoughts, suggestions? 01:08:15,180 --> 01:08:17,180
有什么想法，建议吗？
--Have just everyone pass down the accumulating sum down the rows and then have one person on the end of the row pass the sum. 01:08:17,180 --> 01:08:25,180
让每个人都将累积的总和向下传递到行中，然后让行尾的一个人传递总和。
--Okay. 01:08:25,180 --> 01:08:26,180
好的。
--So maybe like add up across the room like this and then take those numbers and add them up down to the front. 01:08:26,180 --> 01:08:32,180
所以也许就像这样在房间里加起来，然后把这些数字加起来到前面。
--So maybe we get an answer here. 01:08:32,180 --> 01:08:33,180
所以也许我们在这里得到了答案。
--Any other thoughts? 01:08:33,180 --> 01:08:34,180
还有其他想法吗？
--Yep. 01:08:34,180 --> 01:08:35,180
是的。
--Ah, yeah. 01:08:36,180 --> 01:08:39,180
啊，是的。
--That's good. 01:08:39,180 --> 01:08:40,180
那挺好的。
--That way you'd be adding up simultaneously in the same row. 01:08:40,180 --> 01:08:43,180
这样你就可以在同一行中同时加起来。
--So maybe add from each end toward the middle and then when it reaches the middle kind of go toward the front and then somebody can tell me the grand total. 01:08:43,180 --> 01:08:52,180
因此，也许从每一端向中间添加，然后当它到达中间时，向前面添加，然后有人可以告诉我总计。
--Okay. 01:08:52,180 --> 01:08:53,180
好的。
--So let's see. 01:08:53,180 --> 01:08:54,180
让我们看看。
--We added up 16 numbers in 56 seconds. 01:08:54,180 --> 01:08:58,180
我们在 56 秒内将 16 个数字相加。
--So it's like a couple seconds per number with one processor. 01:08:58,180 --> 01:09:02,180
所以它就像一个处理器的每个数字几秒钟。
--Now we're adding up 150 numbers. 01:09:02,180 --> 01:09:04,180
现在我们将 150 个数字相加。
--That's about 10 times more numbers, but we've got 150 processors. 01:09:04,180 --> 01:09:08,180
这是大约 10 倍的数字，但我们有 150 个处理器。
--So it should be blazingly fast. 01:09:08,180 --> 01:09:11,180
所以它应该非常快。
--All right. 01:09:11,180 --> 01:09:12,180
好的。
--Okay. 01:09:12,180 --> 01:09:13,180
好的。
--So is everybody ready? 01:09:13,180 --> 01:09:14,180
那么大家准备好了吗？
--Okay. 01:09:14,180 --> 01:09:15,180
好的。
--So, you know, the algorithm you're going to add toward the middle and then the middle people are going to add toward the front. 01:09:15,180 --> 01:09:21,180
所以，你知道，你要向中间添加的算法，然后中间的人将向前面添加。
--Okay. 01:09:21,180 --> 01:09:23,180
好的。
--Okay. 01:09:23,180 --> 01:09:24,180
好的。
--On your mark, get set, go. 01:09:24,180 --> 01:09:26,180
各就各位，准备就绪，出发。
--Okay. 01:09:26,180 --> 01:09:29,180
好的。
--Okay. 01:09:56,180 --> 01:10:12,180
好的。
--How many courses you're registered for? 01:10:12,180 --> 01:10:16,180
您注册了多少门课程？
--So we're adding up how many courses you're registered for, right? 01:10:16,180 --> 01:10:19,180
所以我们加起来你注册了多少课程，对吧？
--Okay. 01:10:46,180 --> 01:11:03,180
好的。
--Great. 01:11:03,180 --> 01:11:04,180
伟大的。
--Thank you. 01:11:04,180 --> 01:11:05,180
谢谢。
--But that's the wrong answer. 01:11:05,180 --> 01:11:06,180
但这是错误的答案。
--No, I'm kidding. 01:11:06,180 --> 01:11:07,180
不，我在开玩笑。
--I don't have a way to check that. 01:11:07,180 --> 01:11:08,180
我没有办法检查。
--Okay. 01:11:08,180 --> 01:11:09,180
好的。
--So that took 95 seconds. 01:11:09,180 --> 01:11:16,180
所以这花了 95 秒。
--So all right. 01:11:16,180 --> 01:11:19,180
所以好吧。
--Well, using the same kind of ratios there, we would have expected a faster number than that. 01:11:19,180 --> 01:11:25,180
好吧，在那里使用相同类型的比率，我们预计会比这更快。
--That's a little slow, right? 01:11:25,180 --> 01:11:27,180
这有点慢，对吧？
--Given that we had 150 processors here and each of you should be able to add up numbers like one every couple of seconds. 01:11:27,180 --> 01:11:34,180
鉴于我们这里有 150 个处理器，你们每个人都应该能够每隔几秒将一个数字加起来。
--In fact, you know, we have 150 numbers. 01:11:35,180 --> 01:11:37,180
事实上，你知道，我们有 150 个号码。
--So it should have taken something like three, four seconds to add up all those numbers, right? 01:11:37,180 --> 01:11:41,180
所以把所有这些数字加起来应该需要大约三、四秒，对吧？
--Just based on your collective ability to add numbers together. 01:11:41,180 --> 01:11:45,180
仅基于您将数字加在一起的集体能力。
--Something like that. 01:11:45,180 --> 01:11:46,180
像那样的东西。
--So why did it take so much longer than that? 01:11:46,180 --> 01:11:51,180
那么为什么要花比这更长的时间呢？
--Yep. 01:11:51,180 --> 01:11:57,180
是的。
--Yeah, it was all entirely limited on communication. 01:11:57,180 --> 01:12:00,180
是的，这完全取决于沟通。
--So of the 95 seconds, what fraction of that time were you doing anything useful? 01:12:00,180 --> 01:12:06,180
那么在这 95 秒中，您用了多少时间做有用的事情？
--Yeah. 01:12:06,180 --> 01:12:07,180
是的。
--Like almost you're doing, you're spending mostly you're sitting around. 01:12:07,180 --> 01:12:11,180
几乎就像你正在做的那样，你大部分时间都在花钱。
--So that was a case where we're basically doing a massive reduction across the whole room and you're having to, it's completely limited by communication and that's what caused that to be so slow. 01:12:11,180 --> 01:12:24,180
所以在这种情况下，我们基本上要在整个房间内进行大量减少，而你不得不这样做，它完全受到沟通的限制，这就是导致速度如此缓慢的原因。
--Okay. 01:12:24,180 --> 01:12:25,180
好的。
--So. 01:12:25,180 --> 01:12:28,180
所以。
-- 01:12:28,180 --> 01:12:28,180

--So actually, we're going to refer back to a couple of things we just saw in these examples in upcoming lectures as we talk about parallel software. 01:12:28,180 --> 01:12:36,180
所以实际上，当我们谈论并行软件时，我们将在即将到来的讲座中回顾我们刚刚在这些示例中看到的一些事情。
--But to wrap things up, I'm going to talk about some of the themes in the course. 01:12:36,180 --> 01:12:41,180
但总结一下，我将讨论课程中的一些主题。
--So one of them is we want you to learn how to write parallel programs that will scale, that will run faster with more processors. 01:12:41,180 --> 01:12:49,180
因此，其中之一就是我们希望您学习如何编写可扩展的并行程序，这些程序将在更多处理器上运行得更快。
--And you'll need to know how to divide things up evenly. 01:12:49,180 --> 01:12:53,180
你需要知道如何平均分配。
--And it turns out there are a lot of even other issues to think about. 01:12:53,180 --> 01:12:56,180
事实证明，还有很多甚至其他问题需要考虑。
--That's one of them that you saw with a four person demo, but it gets even a lot more interesting than that. 01:12:56,180 --> 01:13:02,180
这是您在四人演示中看到的其中之一，但它比那更有趣。
--So we'll talk about different ways of thinking about parallelism. 01:13:02,180 --> 01:13:06,180
因此，我们将讨论对并行性的不同思考方式。
--In fact, as Randy said, each of the assignments has a completely different abstraction for thinking about parallelism. 01:13:06,180 --> 01:13:15,180
事实上，正如 Randy 所说，每个作业对于并行性的思考都有完全不同的抽象。
--The next thing is about this course is that you will need to learn a bit about how parallel hardware works, because even if you really don't have any interest in hardware at all, 01:13:15,180 --> 01:13:27,180
关于本课程的下一件事是，您将需要学习一些有关并行硬件如何工作的知识，因为即使您真的对硬件根本没有任何兴趣，
--it turns out that unlike just writing software on a normal sequential machine, when you try to make things run faster on a parallel machine, 01:13:27,180 --> 01:13:36,180
事实证明，与仅仅在普通的顺序机器上编写软件不同，当你试图让事情在并行机器上运行得更快时，
--the details of what the hardware is doing under the covers have a very big impact on performance. 01:13:36,180 --> 01:13:42,180
硬件在幕后所做工作的细节对性能有非常大的影响。
--So for that reason, you do need to know some important things about what will limit performance and what will cause bottlenecks. 01:13:43,180 --> 01:13:51,180
因此，出于这个原因，您确实需要了解一些重要的事情，比如什么会限制性能以及什么会导致瓶颈。
--So even if you're not going to design hardware, that's something that you'll need to know about. 01:13:51,180 --> 01:13:56,180
因此，即使您不打算设计硬件，这也是您需要了解的内容。
--Another important theme in the class is efficiency. 01:13:56,180 --> 01:13:59,180
课堂上的另一个重要主题是效率。
--So the goal is not just to be fast, it's to be efficient. 01:13:59,180 --> 01:14:03,180
所以目标不仅仅是要快，还要有效率。
--We want you to use the computational resources efficiently. 01:14:03,180 --> 01:14:07,180
我们希望您有效地使用计算资源。
--So for example, a question is, if you're off at your job or summer internship and you are given this problem to run in parallel and it runs twice as fast on 10 processors, 01:14:07,180 --> 01:14:19,180
例如，一个问题是，如果你休假或暑期实习，你需要并行运行这个问题，并且它在 10 个处理器上的运行速度是原来的两倍，
--is your boss going to give you a huge raise or fire you? 01:14:19,180 --> 01:14:23,180
你的老板会给你大幅加薪还是解雇你？
--Or maybe something in between. 01:14:23,180 --> 01:14:25,180
或者介于两者之间。
--But would that be considered to be good or bad? 01:14:25,180 --> 01:14:29,180
但这会被认为是好事还是坏事？
--It really depends on the scenario. 01:14:33,180 --> 01:14:36,180
这真的取决于场景。
--That's the right answer. 01:14:36,180 --> 01:14:38,180
这是正确的答案。
--Right. So it may be that you just have the 10 processors no matter what. 01:14:42,180 --> 01:14:45,180
正确的。因此，无论如何您可能只有 10 个处理器。
--Like if you think about a GPU on your phone, you have it there anyway. 01:14:45,180 --> 01:14:49,180
就像您考虑在手机上安装 GPU 一样，无论如何您都有它。
--So if you have the resources and your software is not achieving real time frame rate and by making it twice as fast now it is, then that's a huge success. 01:14:49,180 --> 01:14:59,180
因此，如果您拥有资源并且您的软件没有达到实时帧速率，而是通过将其速度提高到现在的两倍，那么这是一个巨大的成功。
--That's really great. 01:14:59,180 --> 01:15:00,180
那真是太棒了。
--But if you're renting time on Amazon Web Services and you're paying for 10 machines but you're getting only a tiny bit of gain from that, then maybe that's not such a good thing. 01:15:00,180 --> 01:15:11,180
但是，如果您在 Amazon Web Services 上租用时间并支付 10 台机器的费用，但您只能从中获得一点点收益，那么这可能不是一件好事。
--But to the extent that you can be efficient, that's important. 01:15:11,180 --> 01:15:15,180
但就您的效率而言，这很重要。
--It's something that's really important for hardware designers as well. 01:15:15,180 --> 01:15:20,180
这对硬件设计师来说也是非常重要的。
--So in particular, before this big change in 2004 when everything was going to start melting if we kept increasing clock rates, 01:15:20,180 --> 01:15:28,180
因此，特别是在 2004 年发生这一巨大变化之前，如果我们不断提高时钟频率，一切都会开始融化，
--the name of the game back then was you get a chip and you're going to put one processor on it, make it as fast as you can make it. 01:15:28,180 --> 01:15:36,180
当时的游戏名称是你得到一个芯片，然后在上面放一个处理器，让它尽可能快。
--So things were getting increasingly speculative and aggressive and inefficient, it turns out, just to squeeze out more and more performance. 01:15:36,180 --> 01:15:45,180
所以事情变得越来越投机、激进和低效，事实证明，这只是为了挤出越来越多的性能。
--But today, it's all about efficiency because once you start putting multiple cores on a chip, the area of each processor is important because if it's smaller, we can fit more of them on. 01:15:45,180 --> 01:15:57,180
但今天，一切都与效率有关，因为一旦你开始在芯片上放置多个内核，每个处理器的面积就很重要，因为如果它更小，我们就可以容纳更多。
--So a really important metric these days is efficiency, performance per unit area of the processor. 01:15:57,180 --> 01:16:04,180
因此，如今一个非常重要的指标是效率，即处理器每单位面积的性能。
--And also, energy efficiency is also very important because both for mobile devices where battery life is important and in the cloud, in a server warehouse, power is also very important because there's only so much power they can get into the building. 01:16:04,180 --> 01:16:21,180
而且，能源效率也非常重要，因为对于电池寿命很重要的移动设备和云端、服务器仓库，电力也非常重要，因为它们只能进入建筑物的电力。
--So basically, that's the last slide here is single-threaded performance is not expected to get faster, so it's all about parallelism. 01:16:21,180 --> 01:16:32,180
所以基本上，这是这里的最后一张幻灯片，单线程性能预计不会变得更快，所以这都是关于并行性的。
--This is not an easy thing to do, which means that the good news is once you get out of this course, you'll have a secret weapon compared to other people out there in the world, which is you'll actually understand these issues. 01:16:32,680 --> 01:16:46,180
这不是一件容易的事，这意味着好消息是，一旦你完成了这门课程，与世界上其他人相比，你将拥有一个秘密武器，那就是你将真正理解这些问题.
--And welcome to the class. So that's it. 01:16:46,180 --> 01:16:49,180
欢迎来到课堂。就是这样了。
